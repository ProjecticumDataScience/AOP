Electronic address: wangq27@mail.sysu.edu.cn. Excessive exposure to 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), a chlorinated organic toxicant, can lead to liver dysfunction. To fully explore the mechanism of 1,2-DCE-induced hepatic abnormalities, 30 male National Institutes of Health (NIH) Swiss mice were exposed to 0, 350, or 700mg/m3 of 1,2-DCE, via inhalation, 6h/day for 28days. Increased liver/body weight ratios, as well as serum AST and serum ALT activity were observed in the 350 and 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE exposure group mice, compared with the control group mice. In addition, decreased body weights were observed in mice exposed to 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE, compared with control mice. Exposure to 350 and 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE also led to significant accumulation of hepatic glycogen, free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides, elevation of blood triglyceride and FFA levels, and decreases in blood glucose levels. Results from microarray analysis indicated that the decreases in glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) and liver glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL) expression, mediated by the activation of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt1), might be responsible for the hepatic glycogen accumulation and steatosis. Further in vitro study demonstrated that 2-chloroacetic acid (1,2-DCE metabolite), rather than 1,2-DCE, up-regulated Akt1 phosphorylation and suppressed G6PC and PYGL expression, resulting in hepatocellular glycogen accumulation. These results suggest that hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis are impaired by 1,2-DCE exposure via down-regulation of PYGL and G6PC expression, which may be primarily mediated by the 2-chloroacetic acid-activated Akt1 pathway.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.

A wide range of novel replacement flame retardants (nFRs) is consistently detected in increasing concentrations in the environment and human matrices. Evidence suggests that nFRs exposure may be associated with disruption of the endocrine system, which has been linked with the etiology of various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a multifactorial disease characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of fats (lipids) in the hepatocytes and involves multiple-hit pathogenesis, including exposure to occupational and environmental chemicals such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of the nFRs-induced hepatic steatosis in the human liver cells. In this study, we employed an in vitro bioassay toolbox to assess the key events (KEs) in the proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOP) (s) for hepatic steatosis. We examined nine nFRs using AOP- based in vitro assays measuring KEs such as lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, gene expression, and in silico approach to identify the putative molecular initiating events (MIEs). Our findings suggest that several tested OPFRs induced lipid accumulation in human liver cell culture. Tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) induced the highest lipid accumulation by altering the expression of genes encoding hepatic de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction depicted by decreased cellular ATP production. Available in vitro data from ToxCast and in silico molecular docking suggests that pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) could be the molecular targets for the tested nFRs. The study identifies several nFRs, such as TMPP and EHDPP, TPHP, and TDCIPP, as potential risk factor for NAFLD and advances our understanding of the mechanisms involved, demonstrating the utility of an AOP-based strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of toxicity.",

BACKGROUND: The earliest manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is steatosis, characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes. Findings from our laboratory have indicated that many pathological changes, including steatosis, correlate with the alcohol-induced hepatocellular increases in S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that an experimental increase in intracellular SAH alone will result in similar steatotic changes to those seen after alcohol exposure. METHODS: Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes grown on collagen-coated plates were exposed to serum-free medium containing 50 µmol/L oleic acid and varying concentrations of 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) to experimentally elevate intracellular SAH levels. RESULTS: Overnight exposure to DZA treatment dose-dependently increased hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation, which was also evident by morphological visualization of larger-sized LDs. The rise in triglycerides and LDs accompanied increases in mRNA and protein levels of several LD-associated proteins known to regulate LD number and size. Furthermore, DZA treatment caused a decline in the levels of lipases that prevent fat accumulation as well as increased the expression of factors involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid mobilization. Collectively, our results indicate that the elevation of intracellular SAH is sufficient to promote fat accumulation in hepatocytes, which is similar to that seen after alcohol exposure.

BACKGROUND: The earliest manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is steatosis, characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes. Findings from our laboratory have indicated that many pathological changes, including steatosis, correlate with the alcohol-induced hepatocellular increases in S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that an experimental increase in intracellular SAH alone will result in similar steatotic changes to those seen after alcohol exposure. METHODS: Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes grown on collagen-coated plates were exposed to serum-free medium containing 50 µmol/L oleic acid and varying concentrations of 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) to experimentally elevate intracellular SAH levels. RESULTS: Overnight exposure to DZA treatment dose-dependently increased hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation, which was also evident by morphological visualization of larger-sized LDs. The rise in triglycerides and LDs accompanied increases in mRNA and protein levels of several LD-associated proteins known to regulate LD number and size. Furthermore, DZA treatment caused a decline in the levels of lipases that prevent fat accumulation as well as increased the expression of factors involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid mobilization. Collectively, our results indicate that the elevation of intracellular SAH is sufficient to promote fat accumulation in hepatocytes, which is similar to that seen after alcohol exposure.

OBJECTIVE: Discovery of specific markers that reflect altered hepatic fatty acid oxidation could help to detect an individual's risk of fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at an early stage. Lipid and protein metabolism are intimately linked, but our understanding of this crosstalk remains limited. METHODS: In male Wistar rats, we used synthetic fatty acid analogues (3-thia fatty acids) as a tool to induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, to gain new insight into the link between fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle-related intermediate metabolites in liver and plasma. RESULTS: Rats treated with 3-thia fatty acids had 3-fold higher hepatic, but not adipose and skeletal muscle, expression of the thioesterase 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (Hibch), which controls the formation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) in the valine degradation pathway. Consequently, 3-thia fatty acid-stimulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis was accompanied by decreased plasma 3-HIB and increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations further downstream in BCAA catabolism. The higher plasma MMA corresponded to higher MMA-CoA hydrolase activity and hepatic expression of GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthase (Suclg2) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdhb), and lower MMA-CoA mutase activity. Plasma 3-HIB correlated positively to plasma and hepatic concentrations of TAG, plasma total fatty acids, plasma NEFA and insulin/glucose ratio, while the reverse correlations were seen for MMA. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insight into TCA cycle-related metabolic changes associated with altered hepatic fatty acid flux, and identifies 3-HIB and MMA as novel circulating markers reflective of mitochondrial β-oxidation in male Wistar rats.",

Testing drugs for interference with hepatic fatty acid metabolism is therefore important. To find out whether HepG2 cells are suitable for this purpose, we investigated the effect of three established fatty acid metabolism inhibitors and of three test compounds on triglyceride accumulation, palmitate metabolism, the acylcarnitine pool and dicarboxylic acid accumulation in the cell supernatant and on ApoB-100 excretion in HepG2 cells. The three established inhibitors [etomoxir, methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA)] depleted mitochondrial ATP at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. They inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or lower concentrations than ATP depletion, and 4-BCA was associated with cellular fat accumulation. They caused specific changes in the acylcarnitine pattern and etomoxir an increase of thapsic (C18 dicarboxylic) acid in the cell supernatant, and did not interfere with ApoB-100 excretion (marker of VLDL export). The three test compounds (amiodarone, tamoxifen, and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2) depleted the cellular ATP content at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred. They all caused cellular fat accumulation and inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or higher concentrations than ATP depletion. They suppressed medium-chain acylcarnitines in the cell supernatant and amiodarone and tamoxifen impaired thapsic acid production. Tamoxifen and WIN 55,212-2 decreased cellular ApoB-100 excretion.

Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid metabolism responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.",

Dietary α-lactalbumin induced fatty liver by enhancing nuclear liver X receptor αβ/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/PPARγ expression and minimising PPARα/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression and AMP-activated protein kinase α phosphorylation associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and oxidative stress in Balb/c mice. López-Oliva ME(1), Muñoz-Martínez E(1). Author information: (1)1Sección Departamental de Fisiología, Facultad de Farmacia,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,28040 Madrid,Spain. (2)2Departamento de Farmacología, Facultad de Farmacia,Universidad Complutense,28040 Madrid,Spain. The effect and the role played by dietary α-lactalbumin (α-LAC) on hepatic fat metabolism are yet to be fully elucidated. We reported previously that α-LAC intake induced atherogenic dyslipidaemia in Balb/c mice. The aim of the present study was to investigate if this atherogenic effect could be due to a possible α-LAC-induced hepatic steatosis. We examine the ability of dietary α-LAC to induce liver steatosis, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic lipid metabolism in association with the lipid profile, peripheral insulin resistance (IR) and changes in the hepatic oxidative environment. Male Balb/c mice (n 6) were fed with diets containing either chow or 14 % α-LAC for 4 weeks. The α-LAC-fed mice developed abdominal adiposity and IR. Moderate liver steatosis with increased TAG and NEFA contents was correlated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. There was increased nuclear expression of liver X receptor αβ (LXRαβ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and PPARγ transcription factors and of the cytosolic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase involved in the hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The opposite was found for the nuclear receptor PPARα and the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), leading to reduced fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). These changes were associated with a significant decrease in both p-Thr172-AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) (inactivation) and p-Ser79-ACC1 (activation) and with a more oxidative liver environment increasing lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and reducing GSH:GSSG ratio in the α-LAC-fed mice. In conclusion, 4 weeks of 14 % α-LAC feeding induced liver steatosis associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia, IR and oxidative stress by enhancing nuclear LXRαβ/SREBP-1c/PPARγ expression and diminishing PPARα/CPT-1 expression and AMPKα phosphorylation shifting the hepatic FAO toward fatty acid synthesis in Balb/c mice.",

Dietary α-lactalbumin induced fatty liver by enhancing nuclear liver X receptor αβ/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/PPARγ expression and minimising PPARα/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression and AMP-activated protein kinase α phosphorylation associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and oxidative stress in Balb/c mice.

(2)2Departamento de Farmacología, Facultad de Farmacia,Universidad Complutense,28040 Madrid,Spain. The effect and the role played by dietary α-lactalbumin (α-LAC) on hepatic fat metabolism are yet to be fully elucidated. We reported previously that α-LAC intake induced atherogenic dyslipidaemia in Balb/c mice. The aim of the present study was to investigate if this atherogenic effect could be due to a possible α-LAC-induced hepatic steatosis. We examine the ability of dietary α-LAC to induce liver steatosis, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic lipid metabolism in association with the lipid profile, peripheral insulin resistance (IR) and changes in the hepatic oxidative environment. Male Balb/c mice (n 6) were fed with diets containing either chow or 14 % α-LAC for 4 weeks. The α-LAC-fed mice developed abdominal adiposity and IR. Moderate liver steatosis with increased TAG and NEFA contents was correlated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. There was increased nuclear expression of liver X receptor αβ (LXRαβ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and PPARγ transcription factors and of the cytosolic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase involved in the hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The opposite was found for the nuclear receptor PPARα and the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), leading to reduced fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). These changes were associated with a significant decrease in both p-Thr172-AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) (inactivation) and p-Ser79-ACC1 (activation) and with a more oxidative liver environment increasing lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and reducing GSH:GSSG ratio in the α-LAC-fed mice. In conclusion, 4 weeks of 14 % α-LAC feeding induced liver steatosis associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia, IR and oxidative stress by enhancing nuclear LXRαβ/SREBP-1c/PPARγ expression and diminishing PPARα/CPT-1 expression and AMPKα phosphorylation shifting the hepatic FAO toward fatty acid synthesis in Balb/c mice.",

Electronic address: huchengmu@ahmu.edu.cn. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease which affects millions of people worldwide. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and oleic acid. APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.",

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and oleic acid. APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.",

Electronic address: huchengmu@ahmu.edu.cn. Alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) is a disease characterized by the abnormal structure and dysfunction of hepatocytes caused by long-term, excessive drinking. Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used painkiller, but it can aggravate lipid deposition in the liver and cause liver injury when used in fatty liver disease. Here, we investigated the effect of caveolin-1 (CAV-1), an intracellular stent protein, on the pathogenesis of APAP aggravated lipid deposition in AFL mice. This study shows that lipid accumulation was more severe in APAP groups than in alcohol-treated mice. The CAV-1 stent-like domain (CSD, 82-101 amino acids of caveolin-1), used to upregulate CAV-1 expression, could reduce lipid accumulation and activate autophagy in AFL mice treated with APAP. The levels of CAV-1 and autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II/I and Beclin-1) had decreased, whereas SREBP-1c had increased in A/O (alcohol and oleic acid) and APAP-co-treated L02 cells. CAV-1 small interfering RNA and CAV1-overexpressing plasmid were separately transfected into A/O and APAP co-treated L02 cells. When CAV-1 was downregulated, the levels of Pink-1, Parkin, and autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II/I and Beclin-1) were decreased, whereas SREBP-1c was increased. The opposite trend was observed when CAV-1 was overexpressed. The results show that CAV-1 reduced lipid accumulation in L02 cells and activated Pink-1/Parkin-related mitophagy. This study highlights the positive role of CAV-1 in APAP-increased lipid accumulation under the AFL status and provides a new understanding of the function of CAV-1 in the liver through mitophagy associated with the Pink-1/Parkin pathway.",

The levels of CAV-1 and autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II/I and Beclin-1) had decreased, whereas SREBP-1c had increased in A/O (alcohol and oleic acid) and APAP-co-treated L02 cells. CAV-1 small interfering RNA and CAV1-overexpressing plasmid were separately transfected into A/O and APAP co-treated L02 cells. When CAV-1 was downregulated, the levels of Pink-1, Parkin, and autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II/I and Beclin-1) were decreased, whereas SREBP-1c was increased. The opposite trend was observed when CAV-1 was overexpressed. The results show that CAV-1 reduced lipid accumulation in L02 cells and activated Pink-1/Parkin-related mitophagy. This study highlights the positive role of CAV-1 in APAP-increased lipid accumulation under the AFL status and provides a new understanding of the function of CAV-1 in the liver through mitophagy associated with the Pink-1/Parkin pathway.",

China (Q.D.) liangyan0679@163.com. The action principles of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) feature multiactive components, multitarget sites, and weak combination with action targets. In the present study, we performed an integrated analysis of metabonomics, proteomics, and lipidomics to establish a scientific research system on the underlying mechanism of TCMs, and Schisandra lignan extract (SLE) was selected as a model TCM. In metabonomics, several metabolic pathways were found to mediate the liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP), and SLE could regulate the disorder of lipid metabolism. The proteomic study further proved that the hepatoprotective effect of SLE was closely related to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Indeed, the results of lipidomics demonstrated that SLE dosing has an obvious callback effect on APAP-induced lipidic profile shift. The contents of 25 diglycerides (DAGs) and 21 triglycerides (TAGs) were enhanced significantly by APAP-induced liver injury, which could further induce liver injury and inflammatory response by upregulating protein kinase C (PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ, and PKCθ). The upregulated lipids and PKCs could be reversed to the normal level by SLE dosing. More importantly, phosphatidic acid phosphatase, fatty acid transport protein 5, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 were proved to be positively associated with the regulation of DAGs and TAGs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Integrated multiomics was first used to reveal the mechanism of APAP-induced acute liver failure (ALF) and the hepatoprotective role of SLE. The results showed that the ALF caused by APAP was closely related to lipid regulation and that SLE dosing could exert a hepatoprotective role by reducing intrahepatic diglyceride and triglyceride levels. Our research can not only promote the application of multicomponent technology in the study of the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicines but also provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of ALF.

Furthermore, AcAc treatment significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which thus decreased VLDL assembly and increased triglyceride (TG) accumulation in these bovine hepatocytes.

Metformin inhibits both oleic acid-induced and CB1R receptor agonist-induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells: The preliminary report. Szuster- (3), (4), Kandefer-Szerszeń M(1).

Fatty liver is characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty acid formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic acid (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

(3)Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology, Basel, Switzerland. Impairment of hepatic fatty acid metabolism can lead to liver steatosis and injury. Testing drugs for interference with hepatic fatty acid metabolism is therefore important. To find out whether HepG2 cells are suitable for this purpose, we investigated the effect of three established fatty acid metabolism inhibitors and of three test compounds on triglyceride accumulation, palmitate metabolism, the acylcarnitine pool and dicarboxylic acid accumulation in the cell supernatant and on ApoB-100 excretion in HepG2 cells. The three established inhibitors [etomoxir, methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA)] depleted mitochondrial ATP at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. They inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or lower concentrations than ATP depletion, and 4-BCA was associated with cellular fat accumulation. They caused specific changes in the acylcarnitine pattern and etomoxir an increase of thapsic (C18 dicarboxylic) acid in the cell supernatant, and did not interfere with ApoB-100 excretion (marker of VLDL export). The three test compounds (amiodarone, tamoxifen, and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2) depleted the cellular ATP content at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred. They all caused cellular fat accumulation and inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or higher concentrations than ATP depletion. They suppressed medium-chain acylcarnitines in the cell supernatant and amiodarone and tamoxifen impaired thapsic acid production. Tamoxifen and WIN 55,212-2 decreased cellular ApoB-100 excretion. In conclusion, the established inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism caused the expected effects in HepG2 cells. HepG cells proved to be useful for the detection of drug-associated toxicities on hepatocellular fatty acid metabolism. PMCID: PMC5924803",

We investigated the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced steatosis. Amiodarone-induced liver injury was obtained by 1 intraperitoneal injection to wild-type (WT) or C/EBP homologous protein knock-out mice (Ddit3-/-). Amiodarone directly reduced intracellular ATP and Ca2+ in hepatocytes invitro, inducing ER stress and lipid accumulation. In vivo, amiodarone-driven liver damage and lipid accumulation was accompanied by activation of ER stress/unfolded protein response, as demonstrated by up-regulation of genes encoding key ER stress mediators and by phosphorylation of eIF2α. In contrast to WT mice, Ddit3-/- mice were protected from amiodarone-induced ER stress and lipid accumulation. Importantly, amiodarone-induced lipid accumulation was not mediated by de novo hepatic lipogenesis, increased adipose tissue lipolysis or increased hepatic uptake of triglycerides or free fatty acids. Rather, amiodarone strongly increased hepatic mRNA expression of lipid droplet proteins, particularly Cidea and Cidec, in WT, but less so in Ddit3-/- mice, suggesting a link between ER stress and increased triglyceride storage. Moreover, while insulin attenuated amiodarone-induced phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in WT, it did not affect pHSL in Ddit3-/-, indicating increased lipolysis and therefore reduced lipid accumulation in these mice. Finally, ER stress attenuation using 2 different pharmacological chaperones reduced lipid accumulation, accompanied by reduced mRNA expression of Cidec. In conclusion, amiodarone-induced ER stress drives liver steatosis and may be considered for therapeutic targeting. © The Author 2017.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of liver disease worldwide and is a growing epidemic. A high ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in the diet has been implicated in the development of NAFLD. However, the inflicted cellular pathology remains unknown. A high ratio may promote lipogenic pathways and contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage, perhaps leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, these parameters were investigated to understand their contribution to NAFLD development. AIM: To examine the effect of increasing ratios of omega-6:3 fatty acids on mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism mediators. METHODS: HepG2-derived VL-17A cells were treated with normal (1:1, 4:1) and high (15:1, 25:1) ratios of omega-6: omega-3 fatty acids [arachidonic acid (AA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] at various time points. Mitochondrial activity and function were examined via MTT assay and Seahorse XF24 analyzer, respectively. Triglyceride accumulation was determined by using EnzyChrom™ and levels of ROS were measured by fluorescence intensity. Protein expression of the mediators of lipogenic, lipolytic and endocannabinoid pathways was assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: High AA:DHA ratio decreased mitochondrial activity (P < 0.01; up to 80%) and promoted intracellular triglyceride accumulation (P < 0.05; 40%-70%). Mechanistically, it altered the mediators of lipid metabolism; increased the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.05; 22%-35%), decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (P < 0.05; 30%-40%) and increased the expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (P < 0.05; 31%). Furthermore, the high ratio increased ROS production (P < 0.01; 74%-115%) and reduced mitochondrial respiratory functions such as basal and maximal respiration, ATP production, spare respiratory capacity and proton leak (P < 0.01; 35%-68%). CONCLUSION: High AA:DHA ratio induced triglyceride accumulation, increased oxidative stress and disrupted mitochondrial functions. Stimulation of lipogenic and steroidal transcription factors may partly mediate these effects and contribute to NAFLD development. ©The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of liver disease worldwide and is a growing epidemic. A high ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in the diet has been implicated in the development of NAFLD. However, the inflicted cellular pathology remains unknown. A high ratio may promote lipogenic pathways and contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage, perhaps leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, these parameters were investigated to understand their contribution to NAFLD development. AIM: To examine the effect of increasing ratios of omega-6:3 fatty acids on mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism mediators. METHODS: HepG2-derived VL-17A cells were treated with normal (1:1, 4:1) and high (15:1, 25:1) ratios of omega-6: omega-3 fatty acids [arachidonic acid (AA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] at various time points. Mitochondrial activity and function were examined via MTT assay and Seahorse XF24 analyzer, respectively. Triglyceride accumulation was determined by using EnzyChrom™ and levels of ROS were measured by fluorescence intensity. Protein expression of the mediators of lipogenic, lipolytic and endocannabinoid pathways was assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: High AA:DHA ratio decreased mitochondrial activity (P < 0.01; up to 80%) and promoted intracellular triglyceride accumulation (P < 0.05; 40%-70%). Mechanistically, it altered the mediators of lipid metabolism; increased the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.05; 22%-35%), decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (P < 0.05; 30%-40%) and increased the expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (P < 0.05; 31%). Furthermore, the high ratio increased ROS production (P < 0.01; 74%-115%) and reduced mitochondrial respiratory functions such as basal and maximal respiration, ATP production, spare respiratory capacity and proton leak (P < 0.01; 35%-68%). CONCLUSION: High AA:DHA ratio induced triglyceride accumulation, increased oxidative stress and disrupted mitochondrial functions. Stimulation of lipogenic and steroidal transcription factors may partly mediate these effects and contribute to NAFLD development. ©The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Metformin inhibits both oleic acid-induced and CB1R receptor agonist-induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells: The preliminary report. Szuster- (3), (4), Kandefer-Szerszeń M(1). Author information: (1)1 Department of Virology and Immunology, Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, Lublin, Poland.

Fatty liver is characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty acid formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic acid (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.

We hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines play a role in lipid storage and induction of liver injury. Therefore, this study intended to explore the expression of adipocytokines and its link to hepatic damage. Rats were assigned to drink water, cola soft drink (free access) and aspartame (240 mg/kg body weight/day orally) for 2 months. The lipid profiles, liver antioxidants and pathology, and mRNA expression of adipogenic cytokines were evaluated. Subchronic intake of soft drink or aspartame substantially induced hyperglycemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia, as represented by increased serum glucose, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with obvious visceral fatty deposition. These metabolic syndromes were associated with the up-regulation of leptin and down-regulation of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression. Moreover, alterations in serum transaminases accompanied by hepatic oxidative stress involving induction of malondialdehyde and reduction of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and glutathione levels are indicative of oxidative hepatic damage. Several cytoarchitecture alterations were detected in the liver, including degeneration, infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis, predominantly with aspartame. These data suggest that long-term intake of soft drink or aspartame-induced hepatic damage may be mediated by the induction of hyperglycemia, lipid accumulation, and oxidative stress with the involvement of adipocytokines.",

Therefore, this study intended to explore the expression of adipocytokines and its link to hepatic damage. Rats were assigned to drink water, cola soft drink (free access) and aspartame (240 mg/kg body weight/day orally) for 2 months. The lipid profiles, liver antioxidants and pathology, and mRNA expression of adipogenic cytokines were evaluated. Subchronic intake of soft drink or aspartame substantially induced hyperglycemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia, as represented by increased serum glucose, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with obvious visceral fatty deposition. These metabolic syndromes were associated with the up-regulation of leptin and down-regulation of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression. Moreover, alterations in serum transaminases accompanied by hepatic oxidative stress involving induction of malondialdehyde and reduction of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and glutathione levels are indicative of oxidative hepatic damage. Several cytoarchitecture alterations were detected in the liver, including degeneration, infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis, predominantly with aspartame. These data suggest that long-term intake of soft drink or aspartame-induced hepatic damage may be mediated by the induction of hyperglycemia, lipid accumulation, and oxidative stress with the involvement of adipocytokines.",

Author information: (1)Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a potentially hepatotoxic group-1 carcinogen taken up by the body through ingestion of daily foods. B[a]P is widely known to cause DNA and protein damages, which are closely related to cell transformation. Accordingly, studies on natural bioactive compounds that attenuate such chemical-induced toxicities have significant impacts on public health. This study aimed to uncover the mechanism of curcumin, the major curcuminoid in turmeric (Curcuma longa), in modulating the lipid accumulation and oxidative stress mediated by B[a]P cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Curcumin treatment reduced the B[a]P-induced lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen spicies (ROS) upregulation and recovered the cell viability. Cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) and Cytochrome P450 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1) downregulation resulting from decreased aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) translocation into nuclei attenuated the effects of B[a]P-induced lipid accumulation and repressed cell viability, respectively. Moreover, the curcumin-induced reduction in ROS generation decreased the nuclear translocation of Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the expression of phase-II detoxifying enzymes. These results indicate that curcumin suppresses B[a]P-induced lipid accumulation and ROS generation which can potentially induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and can shed a light on the detoxifying effect of curcumin.

As a widely used anti-gout drug, benzbromarone has been found to induce hepatic toxicity in patients during clinical treatment. Previous studies have reported that benzbromarone is metabolized via cytochrome P450, thus causing mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that benzbromarone significantly aggravated hepatic steatosis in both obese db/db mice and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mouse models. However, benzbromarone had less effect on the liver of lean mice. It was found that the expression of mRNAs encoding lipid metabolism and some liver-specific genes were obviously disturbed in benzbromarone-treated DIO mice compared to the control group. The inflammatory and oxidative stress factors were also activated in the liver of benzbromarone-treated DIO mice. In accordance with the in vivo results, an in vitro experiment using human hepatoma HepG2 cells also confirmed that benzbromarone promoted intracellular lipid accumulation under high free fatty acids (FFAs) conditions by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism genes. Importantly, prolonged treatment of benzbromarone significantly increased cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells in the presence of high FFAs. In addition, in benzbromarone-treated hyperuricemic patients, serum transaminase levels were positively correlated with patients' obesity level. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that benzbromarone aggravated hepatic steatosis in obese individuals, which could subsequently contribute to hepatic cell injury, suggesting a novel toxicological mechanism in benzbromarone-induced hepatotoxicity.",

As a widely used anti-gout drug, benzbromarone has been found to induce hepatic toxicity in patients during clinical treatment. Previous studies have reported that benzbromarone is metabolized via cytochrome P450, thus causing mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that benzbromarone significantly aggravated hepatic steatosis in both obese db/db mice and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mouse models. However, benzbromarone had less effect on the liver of lean mice. It was found that the expression of mRNAs encoding lipid metabolism and some liver-specific genes were obviously disturbed in benzbromarone-treated DIO mice compared to the control group. The inflammatory and oxidative stress factors were also activated in the liver of benzbromarone-treated DIO mice. In accordance with the in vivo results, an in vitro experiment using human hepatoma HepG2 cells also confirmed that benzbromarone promoted intracellular lipid accumulation under high free fatty acids (FFAs) conditions by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism genes. Importantly, prolonged treatment of benzbromarone significantly increased cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells in the presence of high FFAs. In addition, in benzbromarone-treated hyperuricemic patients, serum transaminase levels were positively correlated with patients' obesity level. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that benzbromarone aggravated hepatic steatosis in obese individuals, which could subsequently contribute to hepatic cell injury, suggesting a novel toxicological mechanism in benzbromarone-induced hepatotoxicity.",

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

Erratum in Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2017 Apr 1;320:73. Emerging evidence has shown that berberine has a protective effect against metabolic syndrome such as obesity and type II diabetes mellitus by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK induces CD36 trafficking to the sarcolemma for fatty acid uptake and oxidation in contracting muscle. However, little is known about the effects of AMPK on CD36 regulation in the liver. We investigated whether AMPK activation by berberine affects CD36 expression and fatty acid uptake in hepatocytes and whether it is linked to hepatic lipid accumulation. Activation of AMPK by berberine or transduction with adenoviral vectors encoding constitutively active AMPK in HepG2 and mouse primary hepatocytes increased the expression and membrane translocation of CD36, resulting in enhanced fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation as determined by BODIPY-C16 and Nile red fluorescence, respectively. Activation of AMPK by berberine induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and subsequently induced CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) binding to the C/EBP-response element in the CD36 promoter in hepatocytes. In addition, hepatic CD36 expression and triglyceride levels were increased in normal diet-fed mice treated with berberine, but completely prevented when hepatic CD36 was silenced with adenovirus containing CD36-specific shRNA. Taken together, prolonged activation of AMPK by berberine increased CD36 expression in hepatocytes, resulting in fatty acid uptake via processes linked to hepatocellular lipid accumulation and fatty liver.",

Electronic address: raribeiro@uepg.br. AIMS: Bisphenol (BP)-A exposure can impair glucose and lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear whether this endocrine disruptor (ED) modulates these processes in postmenopause, a period with organic changes that increase the risk for metabolic diseases. Herein, we evaluated the effects of BPA exposure on adiposity, glucose homeostasis and hepatic steatosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed on a high-fat diet (HFD). MAIN METHODS: Adult Swiss female mice were OVX and submitted to a normolipidic diet or HFD and drinking water without [control (OVX CTL) and OVX HFD groups, respectively] or with 1 μg/mL BPA (OVX CBPA and OVX HBPA groups, respectively), for 3 months. KEY FINDINGS: OVX HFD females displayed increased adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and moderate hepatic steatosis. This effect was associated with a high hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (Srebf1 and Scd1), β-oxidation (Cpt1a) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Hspa5 and Hyou1). BPA did not alter adiposity or glucose homeostasis disruptions induced by HFD. However, this ED triggered severe steatosis, exacerbating hepatic fat and collagen depositions in OVX HBPA, in association with a reduction in Mttp mRNA, and up-regulation of genes involved in β-oxidation (Acox1 and Acadvl), mitochondrial uncoupling (Ucp2), ER stress (Hyou1 and Atf6) and chronic liver injury (Tgfb1and Casp8). Furthermore, BPA caused mild steatosis in OVX CBPA females, increasing the hepatic total lipids and mRNAs for Srebf1, Scd1, Hspa5, Hyou1 and Atf6. SIGNIFICANCE: BPA aggravated hepatic steatosis in OVX mice. Especially when combined with a HFD, BPA caused NAFLD progression, which was partly mediated by chronic ER stress and the TGF-β1 pathway.

Bisphenol A (BPA), a major plasticizers that are commonly used for lining of beverage or food-storage containers, has been shown to increase cholesterol levels with molecular mechanism not clear. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of BPA exposure on liver cholesterol synthesis and hepatic steatosis in male C57BL/6 mice and its underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to different doses (50, 500 and 5000 μg/kg/day) of BPA through diet for 16 weeks. Exposure to low doses (50 and 500 μg/kg/day) of BPA increased hepatic cholesterol content and the expression levels of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and sterol regulatory element binding proteins-2 (SREBP-2). DNA methylation analysis further showed that mice exposed to low-dose BPA decreased the DNA methylation levels of SREBP-2. Moreover, low doses of BPA exposure increased the expression levels of SREBP-1c and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 in the liver, and induced hepatic lipid synthesis and fat accumulation. Our results suggest that low-dose BPA exposure could induce hepatic cholesterol synthesis through decreasing the DNA methylation levels of SREBP-2 and subsequently up-regulating the expression of genes related to cholesterol synthesis in the liver, which causes cholesterol accumulation and further induces liver lipid synthesis and hepatic steatosis.",

Given that microRNA (miRNA) is recognized as a key regulator of lipid metabolism and a potential mediator of environmental cues, this study was designed to explore whether exposure to BPA-triggered abnormal steatosis and lipid accumulation in the liver could be modulated by miR-192. We showed that male post-weaning C57BL/6 mice exposed to 50μg/kg/day of BPA by oral gavage for 90days displayed a NAFLD-like phenotype. In addition, we found in mouse liver and human HepG2 cells that BPA-induced hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation were associated with decreased expression of miR-192, upregulation of SREBF1 and a series of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. Downregulation of miR-192 in BPA-exposed hepatocytes could be due to defective pre-miR-192 processing by DROSHA. Using HepG2 cells, we further confirmed that miR-192 directly acted on the 3'UTR of SREBF1, contributing to dysregulation of lipid homeostasis in hepatocytes. MiR-192 mimic and lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-192 improved BPA-induced hepatic steatosis by suppressing SREBF1. Lastly, we noted that lipid accumulation was not a strict requirement for developing insulin resistance in mice after BPA treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a novel mechanism in which NAFLD associated with BPA exposure arose from alterations in the miR-192-SREBF1 axis.",

Bisphenol A (BPA) and silybin are considered xenoestrogens and could interfere with the action of endogenous hormones. It was demonstrated a higher level of BPA in plasma of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients, compared to those with steatosis (NAFL). We investigated the effect of BPA and silybin, alone or in combination, on proliferation, oxidative stress and steroid metabolism in HepG2 grown in high glucose concentration medium (H-HepG2). Cell viability was assessed by adding 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). TBARS were quantified by spectrophotometry. The effect of BPA, silybin and their combination on the expression of phosphorilized extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), ERK and Caspase 3 was determined by Western blot analysis. The identifications of lipids and steroid hormones was performed by mass spectrometry. BPA elicited in H-HepG2 oxidative stress and steroid hormones oxidation leading to the formation of metabolite with estrogenic and genotoxic potentials. Silybin ameliorates the harmful BPA-induced effect decreasing glucose uptake and lipid peroxidation. Moreover silybin activates the synthesis of vitamin D3 metabolites and prevent the steroid hormones oxidation. BPA could be considered as an important risk factor in worsening and progression of NAFLD. At the same time silybin could be a valid support to counteract these effects in NASH patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acetic acid (AcOH), a short-chain fatty acid, is reported to have some beneficial effects on metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of acetic acid on hepatic lipid metabolism in BRL-3A cells. METHODS: We cultured and treated BRL-3A cells with different concentrations of sodium acetate (neutralized acetic acid) and BML-275 (an AMPKα inhibitor). The total lipid droplet area was measured by oil red O staining, and the triglyceride content was determined by a triglyceride detection kit. We detected mRNA and protein levels of lipid metabolism-related signalling molecules by RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Acetic acid treatment increased AMPKα phosphorylation, which subsequently increased the expression and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and upregulated the expression of lipid oxidation genes. These changes ultimate led to increasing levels of lipid oxidation in BRL-3A cells. Furthermore, elevated AMPKα phosphorylation reduced the expression and transcriptional activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, which reduced the expression of lipogenic genes, thereby decreasing lipid biosynthesis in BRL-3A cells. Consequently, triglyceride content in acetate-treated BRL-3A cells was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that acetic acid activates the AMPKα signalling pathway, leading to increased lipid oxidation and decreased lipid synthesis in BRL-3A cells, thereby reducing liver fat accumulation in vitro. © 2018 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acetic acid (AcOH), a short-chain fatty acid, is reported to have some beneficial effects on metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of acetic acid on hepatic lipid metabolism in BRL-3A cells. METHODS: We cultured and treated BRL-3A cells with different concentrations of sodium acetate (neutralized acetic acid) and BML-275 (an AMPKα inhibitor). The total lipid droplet area was measured by oil red O staining, and the triglyceride content was determined by a triglyceride detection kit. We detected mRNA and protein levels of lipid metabolism-related signalling molecules by RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Acetic acid treatment increased AMPKα phosphorylation, which subsequently increased the expression and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and upregulated the expression of lipid oxidation genes. These changes ultimate led to increasing levels of lipid oxidation in BRL-3A cells. Furthermore, elevated AMPKα phosphorylation reduced the expression and transcriptional activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, which reduced the expression of lipogenic genes, thereby decreasing lipid biosynthesis in BRL-3A cells. Consequently, triglyceride content in acetate-treated BRL-3A cells was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that acetic acid activates the AMPKα signalling pathway, leading to increased lipid oxidation and decreased lipid synthesis in BRL-3A cells, thereby reducing liver fat accumulation in vitro. © 2018 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND & AIM: Fructose diets have been shown to induce insulin resistance and to alter liver metabolism and gut barrier function, ultimately leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Citrulline, Glutamine and Arginine may improve insulin sensitivity and have beneficial effects on gut trophicity. Our aim was to evaluate their effects on liver and gut functions in a rat model of fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 58) received a 4-week fructose (60%) diet or standard chow with or without Citrulline (0.15 g/d) or an isomolar amount of Arginine or Glutamine. All diets were made isonitrogenous by addition of non-essential amino acids. At week 4, nutritional and metabolic status (plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and amino acids, net intestinal absorption) was determined; steatosis (hepatic triglycerides content, histological examination) and hepatic function (plasma aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) were assessed; and gut barrier integrity (myeloperoxidase activity, portal endotoxemia, tight junction protein expression and localization) and intestinal and hepatic inflammation were evaluated. We also assessed diets effects on caecal microbiota. RESULTS: In these experimental isonitrogenous fructose diet conditions, fructose led to steatosis with dyslipidemia but without altering glucose homeostasis, liver function or gut permeability. Fructose significantly decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and tended to increase endotoxemia. Arginine and Glutamine supplements were ineffective but Citrulline supplementation prevented hypertriglyceridemia and attenuated liver fat accumulation. CONCLUSION: While nitrogen supply alone can attenuate fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Citrulline appears to act directly on hepatic lipid metabolism by partially preventing hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and associated protein aggregation are closely associated with human diseases, including alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. Inhibition of ER stress can have a significant effect on the prevention of hepatic dyslipidemia. Here, we studied the role of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, on ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. We studied ER stress induction following CCl4 exposure and delineated mechanisms of the CCl4-induced ER stress response in liver tissue from mice. CCl4 affected the formation of disulfide bonds through excessive hyper-oxidation of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Increased complex formation between PDI and its client proteins persisted in CCl4-exposed samples. Conversely, 4-PBA inhibited ER stress via secretion of apolipoprotein B and prevention of hepatic lipid accumulation. We also studied the mechanism-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and identified the ER stress-related proteins GRP78 and CHOP, along with plasma apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels, as novel biomarkers of ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. ER stress and its clinical relevance for therapeutic approaches were well correlated with the activity of the ER stress regulator 4-PBA, which may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of hepatic lipid accumulation, such as hepatic steatosis.",

(3)Adipocytes and Metabolic Disorders Lab, Food Science and Nutrition Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. chinnasamyksu@gmail.com. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver inflammation stimulates various inflammatory cytokines and initiates injury through oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to curtaile the liver injury through natural principles such as 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzoic acid (HMBA). METHODS: The current study examines the hepatoprotective and lipid lowering effect of HMBA against carbon tetra chloride (CCl4)-mediated liver toxicity in male Wistar rats. RESULTS: The hepatoprotective effects of HMBA against CCl4-induced liver damage, were evident from low serum transaminases activities, reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation and collagen content, restoration of total glutathione, and recouping of the inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-6 levels. Further it was found that the treatment of HMBA, significantly lowered (P<0.01) the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids in serum and liver. To investigate the mechanism behind the hepatoprotective and lipid lowering effect, the activities of heme oxygenase (HO1), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured and expression levels were quantified through western blot following HMBA administration. The results showed that HMBA administration significantly decreased the activity of HO1 (P<0.001), and increased the activity of MPO (P<0.001); further similar finding was observed in western analysis. The hepatoprotective, lipid lowering and shifting key defensive enzyme activities are similar to that of standard drug such as N-acetylcysteine. CONCLUSION: HMBA is competent of shielding liver from CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, and this is associated with the lipid lowering, inflammatory cytokine restoration and induction of defensive enzyme activities.",

Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (the \"bad\" fat), especially palmitate (PA), in the human diet are blamed for potential health risks such as obesity and cancer because of SFA-induced lipotoxicity. However, epidemiological results demonstrate a latent benefit of SFAs, and it remains elusive whether a certain low level of SFAs is physiologically essential for maintaining cell metabolic hemostasis. Here, we demonstrate that although high-level PA (HPA) indeed induces lipotoxic effects in liver cells, low-level PA (LPA) increases mitochondrial functions and alleviates the injuries induced by HPA or hepatoxic agent carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). LPA treatment in mice enhanced liver mitochondrial activity and reduced CCl4 hepatotoxicity with improved blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (m-AST). LPA-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by CDK1-mediated SIRT3 phosphorylation, which in turn deacetylates and dimerizes CPT2 to enhance fatty acid oxidation. Thus, an advantageous effect is suggested by the consumption of LPA that augments mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis via CDK1-SIRT3-CPT2 cascade.

(2)240 Wise Center Drive, P.O. Box 6100, Mississippi State University, MS 39762, United States. Hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic insulin resistance as well as hypertriglyceridemia. Recent studies have determined exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides can cause dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. However, the mechanisms through which OPs induced hepatic steatosis are not completely understood. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if direct exposure to an OP insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPS), could promote hepatic steatosis and identify putative mechanisms of CPS-induced steatosis. To determine if CPS exposure increased intracellular lipid accumulation, McA-RH7777 cells were incubated with CPS for 48 h then lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O staining. Exposure to CPS significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in Oil Red O staining appears to be due to increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation. In addition to increasing neutral lipid accumulation under normal growth conditions, exposure to CPS increased free fatty acid-induced intracellular neutral lipid accumulation. CPS induced increases in intracellular neutral lipid/triglyceride accumulation appear to be due to increased extracellular free fatty acid accumulation, increased de novo lipogenesis, and decreased fatty acidinduced triglyceride secretion. In summary, the present studies indicate exposure to CPS can have a direct effect on the hepatocyte to promote hepatic steatosis by increasing intracellular lipid/triglyceride accumulation through increased extracellular free fatty acid accumulation, increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and decreased triglyceride efflux.",

Exposure to chlorpyrifos increases neutral lipid accumulation with accompanying increased de novo lipogenesis and decreased triglyceride secretion in McArdle-RH7777 hepatoma cells.

(2)240 Wise Center Drive, P.O. Box 6100, Mississippi State University, MS 39762, United States. Hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic insulin resistance as well as hypertriglyceridemia. Recent studies have determined exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides can cause dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. However, the mechanisms through which OPs induced hepatic steatosis are not completely understood. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if direct exposure to an OP insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPS), could promote hepatic steatosis and identify putative mechanisms of CPS-induced steatosis. To determine if CPS exposure increased intracellular lipid accumulation, McA-RH7777 cells were incubated with CPS for 48 h then lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O staining. Exposure to CPS significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in Oil Red O staining appears to be due to increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation. In addition to increasing neutral lipid accumulation under normal growth conditions, exposure to CPS increased free fatty acid-induced intracellular neutral lipid accumulation. CPS induced increases in intracellular neutral lipid/triglyceride accumulation appear to be due to increased extracellular free fatty acid accumulation, increased de novo lipogenesis, and decreased fatty acidinduced triglyceride secretion. In summary, the present studies indicate exposure to CPS can have a direct effect on the hepatocyte to promote hepatic steatosis by increasing intracellular lipid/triglyceride accumulation through increased extracellular free fatty acid accumulation, increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and decreased triglyceride efflux.",

Oral administration of Nigella sativa oil ameliorates the effect of cisplatin on membrane enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative damage in rat liver. Khan AA(2), . Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002, U.P., India. (2)Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, J. N. Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002, U.P., India. Cisplatin (CP) is a potent anti-cancer drug widely used against solid tumors. However, it exhibits pronounced adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Several strategies were attempted to prevent CP hepatotoxicity but were not found suitable for therapeutic application. Nigella sativa has been shown to prevent/reduce the progression of certain type of cardiovascular, kidney and liver diseases. Present study investigates whether N. sativa oil (NSO) can prevent CP induced hepatotoxic effects. Rats were divided into four groups viz. control, CP, NSO and CPNSO. Animals in CPNSO and NSO group were administered NSO (2 ml/kg bwt, orally) with or without single hepatotoxic dose of CP (6 mg/kg bwt, i.p.) respectively. CP hepatotoxicity was recorded by increased serum ALT and AST activities. CP treatment caused oxidant/antioxidant imbalances as reflected by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Furthermore, the activities of various carbohydrate metabolism and membrane enzymes were altered by CP treatment. In contrast, NSO administration to CP treated rats, markedly ameliorated the CP elicited deleterious alterations in liver. Histopathological observations showed extensive liver damage in CP treated animals while greatly reduced tissue injury in CPNSO group. In conclusion, NSO appears to protect CP induced hepatotoxicity by improving energy metabolism and strengthening antioxidant defense mechanism. PMCID: PMC5615832",

Clozapine is widely employed in the treatment of schizophrenia. Compared with that of atypical first-generation antipsychotics, atypical second-generation antipsychotics such as clozapine have less severe side effects and may positively affect obesity and blood glucose level. However, no systematic study of clozapine's adverse metabolic effects-such as changes in kidney and liver function, body weight, glucose and triglyceride levels, and retinopathy-was conducted. This research investigated how clozapine affects weight, the bodily distribution of chromium, liver damage, fatty liver scores, glucose homeostasis, renal impairment, and retinopathy in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). We discovered that obese mice treated with clozapine gained more weight and had greater kidney, liver, and retroperitoneal and epididymal fat pad masses; higher daily food efficiency; higher serum or hepatic triglyceride, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels; and higher hepatic lipid regulation marker expression than did the HFD-fed control mice. Furthermore, the clozapine group mice exhibited insulin resistance, poorer insulin sensitivity, greater glucose intolerance, and less Akt phosphorylation; their GLUT4 expression was lower, they had renal damage, more reactive oxygen species, and IL-1 expression, and, finally, their levels of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) were lower. Moreover, clozapine reduced the thickness of retinal cell layers and increased iNOS and NF-κB expression; a net negative chromium balance occurred because more chromium was excreted through urine, and this influenced chromium mobilization, which did not help overcome the hyperglycemia. Our clozapine group had considerably higher fatty liver scores, which was supported by the findings of lowered adiponectin protein levels and increased FASN protein, PNPLA3 protein, FABP4 mRNA, and SREBP1 mRNA levels. We conclude that clozapine can worsen nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and kidney and retinal injury. Therefore, long-term administration of clozapine warrants higher attention.

Clozapine is widely employed in the treatment of schizophrenia. Compared with that of atypical first-generation antipsychotics, atypical second-generation antipsychotics such as clozapine have less severe side effects and may positively affect obesity and blood glucose level. However, no systematic study of clozapine's adverse metabolic effects-such as changes in kidney and liver function, body weight, glucose and triglyceride levels, and retinopathy-was conducted. This research investigated how clozapine affects weight, the bodily distribution of chromium, liver damage, fatty liver scores, glucose homeostasis, renal impairment, and retinopathy in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). We discovered that obese mice treated with clozapine gained more weight and had greater kidney, liver, and retroperitoneal and epididymal fat pad masses; higher daily food efficiency; higher serum or hepatic triglyceride, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels; and higher hepatic lipid regulation marker expression than did the HFD-fed control mice. Furthermore, the clozapine group mice exhibited insulin resistance, poorer insulin sensitivity, greater glucose intolerance, and less Akt phosphorylation; their GLUT4 expression was lower, they had renal damage, more reactive oxygen species, and IL-1 expression, and, finally, their levels of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) were lower. Moreover, clozapine reduced the thickness of retinal cell layers and increased iNOS and NF-κB expression; a net negative chromium balance occurred because more chromium was excreted through urine, and this influenced chromium mobilization, which did not help overcome the hyperglycemia. Our clozapine group had considerably higher fatty liver scores, which was supported by the findings of lowered adiponectin protein levels and increased FASN protein, PNPLA3 protein, FABP4 mRNA, and SREBP1 mRNA levels. We conclude that clozapine can worsen nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and kidney and retinal injury. Therefore, long-term administration of clozapine warrants higher attention.

Nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease (NAFLD) is the result of imbalances in hepatic lipid partitioning and is linked to dietary factors. We demonstrate that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) when given to mice as a dietary supplement, induced an enlarged liver, hepatic steatosis, and increased plasma levels of fatty acid (FA), alanine transaminase, and triglycerides. The progression of NAFLD and insulin resistance was reversed by GW6471 a small-molecule antagonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Transcriptional profiling of livers revealed that the genes involved in FA oxidation and lipogenesis as two core gene programs controlled by PPARα in response to CLA and GW6471 including Acaca and Acads. Bioinformatic analysis of PPARα ChIP-seq data set and ChIP-qPCR showed that GW6471 blocks PPARα binding to Acaca and Acads and abolishes the PPARα-mediated local histone modifications of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in CLA-treated hepatocytes. Thus, our findings reveal a dual role of PPARα in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and highlight its druggable nature in NAFLD. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

Background and Aims: Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to fatty liver. However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis. Methods: Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls. Results: We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., irbesartan, fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade. Conclusion: Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5263149",

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

Dexamethasone (DEX) is a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated a potentially protective dexamethasone influence on hepatocellular lipid metabolism and fatty acid (FA) transporters expression. The HepG2 cells were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) and/or dexamethasone in two different time expositions (16 h and 40 h). Intracellular and extracellular lipid and sphingolipid concentrations were estimated by the gas-liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The protein expression involved in FA uptake and lipid metabolism was determined by immunoblotting. The treatment of HepG2 with dexamethasone and palmitate enhanced lipid transport to the cell via increased especially FABPpm expression and resulted in the increased triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide deposition. Dexamethasone with palmitate treatment altered FA composition resulting in the elevated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) activity in DAG and TAG and the diminished n-6 PUFA activity in DAG after prolonged exposure.

The lncRNA ENST00000608794 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate PDK4 expression by sponging miR-15b-5p in dexamethasone induced steatosis. .

The contribution of ncRNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to drug induced steatosis remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA ENST00000608794 in dexamethasone induced steatosis. We found that ENST00000608794 is expressed at higher levels in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell, and ENST00000608794 can bind and be regulated by miR-15b-5p. Ectopic expression of ENST00000608794 enhanced steatosis and the protein expression of PDK4 which is a critical gene in lipid metabolism and also is a target of miR-15b-5p. However, the differentiated PDK4 expression between control and ectopic expression of ENST00000608794 was absence in the presence of miR-15b-5p inhibitor. Moreover, in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell lines, ENST00000608794 increased whether with miR-15b-5p inhibitor treatment or not, while increase of PDK4 expression by dexamethasone was greatly compromised in the presence of miR-15b-5p mimic. Meanwhile, dexamethasone induced steatosis could be ameliorated by silencing ENST00000608794 or expressing miR-15b-5p. Taken together, the results suggested that ENST00000608794 plays an important role in dexamethasone induced steatosis, which was partly mediated by derepressing of PDK4 through competitively binding to miR-15b-5p.",

Chronic or excess glucocorticoid exposure causes lipid disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like 4), a primary target gene of the glucocorticoid receptor in hepatocytes and adipocytes, is required for hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Angptl4 has also been shown to be required for dexamethasone-induced hepatic ceramide production. Here, we further examined the role of ceramide-mediated signaling in hepatic dyslipidemia caused by chronic glucocorticoid exposure. Using a stable isotope-labeling technique, we found that dexamethasone treatment induced the rate of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis. These dexamethasone responses were compromised in Angptl4-null mice (Angptl4-/-). Treating mice with myriocin, an inhibitor of the rate-controlling enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase long-chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1)/SPTLC2, decreased dexamethasone-induced plasma and liver triglyceride levels in WT but not Angptl4-/- mice. We noted similar results in mice infected with adeno-associated virus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting Sptlc2. Protein phosphatase 2 phosphatase activator (PP2A) and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) are two known downstream effectors of ceramides. We found here that mice treated with an inhibitor of PKCζ, 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD), had lower levels of dexamethasone-induced triglyceride accumulation in plasma and liver. However, small hairpin RNA-mediated targeting of the catalytic PP2A subunit (Ppp2ca) had no effect on dexamethasone responses on plasma and liver triglyceride levels. Overall, our results indicate that chronic dexamethasone treatment induces an ANGPTL4-ceramide-PKCζ axis that activates hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, resulting in lipid disorders. © 2019 Chen et al.

Overall, our results indicate that chronic dexamethasone treatment induces an ANGPTL4-ceramide-PKCζ axis that activates hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, resulting in lipid disorders. © 2019 Chen et al.

Chronic or excess glucocorticoid exposure causes lipid disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like 4), a primary target gene of the glucocorticoid receptor in hepatocytes and adipocytes, is required for hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Angptl4 has also been shown to be required for dexamethasone-induced hepatic ceramide production. Here, we further examined the role of ceramide-mediated signaling in hepatic dyslipidemia caused by chronic glucocorticoid exposure. Using a stable isotope-labeling technique, we found that dexamethasone treatment induced the rate of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis. These dexamethasone responses were compromised in Angptl4-null mice (Angptl4-/-). Treating mice with myriocin, an inhibitor of the rate-controlling enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase long-chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1)/SPTLC2, decreased dexamethasone-induced plasma and liver triglyceride levels in WT but not Angptl4-/- mice. We noted similar results in mice infected with adeno-associated virus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting Sptlc2. Protein phosphatase 2 phosphatase activator (PP2A) and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) are two known downstream effectors of ceramides. We found here that mice treated with an inhibitor of PKCζ, 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD), had lower levels of dexamethasone-induced triglyceride accumulation in plasma and liver. However, small hairpin RNA-mediated targeting of the catalytic PP2A subunit (Ppp2ca) had no effect on dexamethasone responses on plasma and liver triglyceride levels.

Synthetic and natural glucocorticoids are able to highly modify liver lipid metabolism, which is possibly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development. We have assessed the changes in lipid and sphingolipid contents in hepatocytes, lipid composition and saturation status as well as the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid transport after both dexamethasone and palmitate treatments. The experiments were conducted on primary rat hepatocytes, incubated with dexamethasone and/or palmitic acid during short (16 h) and prolonged (40 h) exposure. Intracellular and extracellular lipid and sphingolipid contents were assessed by gas liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The expression of selected proteins was estimated by Western blotting. Short and prolonged exposure to dexamethasone combined with palmitic acid resulted in increased expression of fatty acid transporters, which was subsequently reflected by excessive intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerols and ceramide. The expression of microsomal transfer protein and cassette transporter was also significantly increased after dexamethasone and palmitate treatment, which was in accordance with elevated extracellular lipid and sphingolipid contents. Our data showed additive effects of dexamethasone and palmitate on protein-dependent fatty acid uptake in primary hepatocytes, resulting in the increased accumulation of triacylglycerols and sphingolipids. Moreover, the combined treatment altered fatty acid composition and diminished triacylglycerols desaturation index. Importantly, we observed that additive effects on both increased microsomal transport protein expression as well as elevated export of triacylglycerols, which may be relevant as a liver protective mechanism. © 2016 Society for Endocrinology.",

Author information: (1)1Department of Child Health Care, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, China. (2)2Institute of Paediatric Research, Nanjing Medical University, 140 Hanzhong Road, Nanjing, China. BACKGROUND: Postnatal overfeeding activates tissue glucocorticoid (GC) activity by up-regulating 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) and increasing sensitivity to high-fat (HF) diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of postnatal overfeeding on GC regulation and lipogenesis in the liver and to observe the impact of GC on hepatocyte lipid metabolism. METHODS: In vivo, Male Sprague-Dawley rat pup litters were adjusted to litter sizes of three (small litter, SL) or ten (normal litter, NL) on postnatal day 3 and then given standard chow from postnatal week 3 (W3) to W13. In vitro, HepG2 cells were stimulated by GC, mifepristone (Mi) or GC + Mi within 48 h, followed by sodium oleate (OA) intervention (or not) for 24 h. Intracellular lipid droplets, triglyceride (TG) concentrations and gene expression related to lipid metabolism were measured in hepatic tissues or HepG2 cells. RESULTS: In vivo, weight gain in the body and liver and TG concentrations in the liver were significantly increased in the SL rats compared to the NL rats at W3 and W13 (p < 0.05); mRNA expression of hepatic 11β-HSD1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and their nuclear transcription factor, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (p < 0.05), was also increased. In vitro, intracellular lipid droplets and TG content in HepG2 cells increased under stimulation with GC or OA (p < 0.05); the increase was more significant following treatment with GC and OA together (p < 0.05). The ACC, SCD1, FASN and SREBP-1c mRNA expression changes were highly similar to the changes in TG content in cells. All the changes induced by GC disappeared when the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was blocked by Mi. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal overfeeding induced GC overexposure through 11β-HSD1 up-regulation in the liver. GC activated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) via GR and led to hepatic lipid accumulation, which increased the risk of NAFLD during adulthood.

A patented organotin di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato)tin (DBDCT) with high a antitumor activity was designed, however, its antitumor and toxic mechanisms have not yet been clearly illustrated. Hepatic proteins of DBDCT-treated rats were identified and analyzed using LC-MS/MS with label-free quantitative technology. In total, 149 differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified. Five protein and mRNA expressions were involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including a scavenger receptor (CD36), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), enoyl-CoA hydratase (EHHADH), acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in DBDCT-treated Rat Liver (BRL) cells. PPAR-α and PPAR-λ were also significantly decreased at both protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, compared with the DBDCT treatment group, a special blocking agent of PPAR-λ T0070907 was used to evaluate the relationship between PPAR-λ and its downstream genes. Our studies indicated that DBDCT may serve as a modulator of PPAR-λ, further up-regulating CD36, FABP4 and EHHADH on the PPAR signal pathway.

A patented organotin di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato)tin (DBDCT) with high a antitumor activity was designed, however, its antitumor and toxic mechanisms have not yet been clearly illustrated. Hepatic proteins of DBDCT-treated rats were identified and analyzed using LC-MS/MS with label-free quantitative technology. In total, 149 differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified. Five protein and mRNA expressions were involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including a scavenger receptor (CD36), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), enoyl-CoA hydratase (EHHADH), acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in DBDCT-treated Rat Liver (BRL) cells. PPAR-α and PPAR-λ were also significantly decreased at both protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, compared with the DBDCT treatment group, a special blocking agent of PPAR-λ T0070907 was used to evaluate the relationship between PPAR-λ and its downstream genes. Our studies indicated that DBDCT may serve as a modulator of PPAR-λ, further up-regulating CD36, FABP4 and EHHADH on the PPAR signal pathway.

Exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) exacerbates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and may systemically affect lipid metabolism. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) have anti-inflammatory activity and suppresses hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation, but many daily diets are deficient in this nutrient. Therefore, the effect of DE exposure in mice fed n-3 PUFA-deficient diet was investigated. Mice were fed control chow or n-3 PUFA-deficient diet for 4 weeks, then exposed to clean air or DE by inhalation for further 4 weeks. Liver histology, plasma parameters, and expression of fatty acid synthesis-related genes were evaluated. N-3 PUFA-deficient diet increased hepatic lipid droplets accumulation and expression of genes promoting fatty acid synthesis: Acaca, Acacb, and Scd1. DE further increased the plasma leptin and the expression of fatty acid synthesis-related genes: Acacb, Fasn, and Scd1. N-3 PUFA-deficient diet and DE exposure potentially enhanced hepatic fatty acid synthesis and subsequently accumulation of lipid droplets. The combination of low-dose DE exposure and intake of n-3 PUFA-deficient diet may be an additional risk factor for the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The present study suggests an important mechanism for preventing toxicity of DE on the liver through the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs in the diet.",

OBJECTIVE: Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.

Background and Aims: Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to fatty liver. However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis. Methods: Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls. Results: We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., irbesartan, fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade. Conclusion: Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5263149",

Electronic address: c.zhou@uky.edu. Erratum in J Hepatol. 2021 Apr;74(4):1003-1004. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The most prescribed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, has been associated with elevated risk of dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in HIV-infected patients but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in mediating the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid homeostasis. METHODS: Cell-based reporter assays, primary cell culture, and multiple mouse models including conditional knockout and humanized mice were combined to study the impact of efavirenz on PXR activities and lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. A novel liver-specific Pxr knockout mouse model was also generated to determine the contribution of hepatic PXR signaling to efavirenz-elicited dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: We found that efavirenz is a potent PXR-selective agonist that can efficiently activate PXR and induce its target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with efavirenz-induced hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis in mice but deficiency of hepatic PXR abolished these adverse effects. Interestingly, efavirenz-mediated PXR activation regulated the expression of several key hepatic lipogenic genes including fatty acid transporter CD36 and cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), leading to increased lipid uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatic cells. While CD36 is a known PXR target gene, we identified a DR-2-type of PXR-response element in the SQLE promoter and established SQLE as a direct transcriptional target of PXR. Since PXR exhibits considerable differences in its pharmacology across species, we also confirmed these findings in PXR-humanized mice and human primary hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The widely prescribed antiretroviral drug efavirenz induces hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis by activating PXR signaling. Activation of PXR should be taken into consideration for patients undergoing long-term treatment with PXR agonistic antiretroviral drugs. LAY SUMMARY: Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-infected patients but has some side effects. It can increase lipid levels in patients' blood and liver. Here we show that efavirenz can activate a unique liver protein called PXR which mediates the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid levels in mouse models. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Helsley RN(1), Park SH(1), Greenberg RN(2), . Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA. (2)Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA. (3)Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA. Electronic address: c.zhou@uky.edu. Erratum in J Hepatol. 2021 Apr;74(4):1003-1004. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The most prescribed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, has been associated with elevated risk of dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in HIV-infected patients but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in mediating the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid homeostasis. METHODS: Cell-based reporter assays, primary cell culture, and multiple mouse models including conditional knockout and humanized mice were combined to study the impact of efavirenz on PXR activities and lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. A novel liver-specific Pxr knockout mouse model was also generated to determine the contribution of hepatic PXR signaling to efavirenz-elicited dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: We found that efavirenz is a potent PXR-selective agonist that can efficiently activate PXR and induce its target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with efavirenz-induced hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis in mice but deficiency of hepatic PXR abolished these adverse effects. Interestingly, efavirenz-mediated PXR activation regulated the expression of several key hepatic lipogenic genes including fatty acid transporter CD36 and cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), leading to increased lipid uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatic cells. While CD36 is a known PXR target gene, we identified a DR-2-type of PXR-response element in the SQLE promoter and established SQLE as a direct transcriptional target of PXR. Since PXR exhibits considerable differences in its pharmacology across species, we also confirmed these findings in PXR-humanized mice and human primary hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The widely prescribed antiretroviral drug efavirenz induces hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis by activating PXR signaling. Activation of PXR should be taken into consideration for patients undergoing long-term treatment with PXR agonistic antiretroviral drugs. LAY SUMMARY: Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-infected patients but has some side effects. It can increase lipid levels in patients' blood and liver. Here we show that efavirenz can activate a unique liver protein called PXR which mediates the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid levels in mouse models. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we study the effect of Entinostat, a synthetic HDAC inhibitor undergoing clinical trials, on hepatic lipid metabolism in the paradigmatic HepaRG liver cell line.

Here we study the effect of Entinostat, a synthetic HDAC inhibitor undergoing clinical trials, on hepatic lipid metabolism in the paradigmatic HepaRG liver cell line. Specifically, we statistically quantify lipid droplet morphology at single cell level utilizing label-free microscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, supported by gene expression. We observe Entinostat efficiently rerouting carbohydrates and free-fatty acids into lipid droplets, upregulating lipid coat protein gene Plin4, and relocating droplets nearer to the nucleus. Our results demonstrate the power of Entinostat to promote lipid synthesis and storage, allowing reduced systemic sugar levels and sequestration of toxic metabolites within protected protein-coated droplets, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Feeding of rapeseed (canola) oil with a high erucic acid concentration is known to cause hepatic steatosis in animals. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation plays a central role in liver lipid homeostasis, so it is possible that hepatic metabolism of erucic acid might decrease mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. However, the precise mechanistic relationship between erucic acid levels and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is unclear. Using male Sprague-Dawley rats, along with biochemical and molecular biology approaches, we report here that peroxisomal β-oxidation of erucic acid stimulates malonyl-CoA formation in the liver and thereby suppresses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Excessive hepatic uptake and peroxisomal β-oxidation of erucic acid resulted in appreciable peroxisomal release of free acetate, which was then used in the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Peroxisomal metabolism of erucic acid also remarkably increased the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, suppressed sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity, and thereby activated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which stimulated malonyl-CoA biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA. Chronic feeding of a diet including high-erucic-acid rapeseed oil diminished mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and caused hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in the rats. Of note, administration of a specific peroxisomal β-oxidation inhibitor attenuated these effects. Our findings establish a cross-talk between peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Electronic address: lfylzc123@163.com. Estradiol (E2) is a sex steroid hormone that modulates multiple physiological processes in teleosts. The aim of this study was to explore the role of E2 in the hepatic lipid metabolism of hybrid tilapia. The hybrid tilapias were injected with different concentrations of E2 (0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) (35 mg/kg) (an E2 receptor antagonist). Subsequently, the liver lipid depositions were analyzed by tissue sections with oil red O staining. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were assayed from the fish in different groups. Genes related to very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly, lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptors, fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol metabolism were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that 50 mg/kg E2 injections enlarged the lipid droplets significantly. Simultaneously, the E2 injections tended to upregulate TC, TG, LDL, and HDL in the serum. The 50 mg/kg E2 group showed a significantly higher expression of the VLDL assembly genes but depressed levels of LDLR and LRP1. In addition, FABP3, FABP11a and DGAT2 were significantly elevated, while CD36 and ACO1 decreased in the 50 mg/kg E2 injection. The ICI injection inhibited the expression of MTP, LPL, LRP1, CD36, FABP11a, ACO1 and FAS in tilapia livers. These results demonstrated that by stimulating the expression of genes associated with the VLDL assembly, inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptor-related genes and promoting the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the TG, E2 induced deposition of lipids in the livers of hybrid tilapia. Overall, the results suggest a role for E2 in fish lipid metabolisms that provide new clues to illustrate the sex steroid function in energy metabolism in livers.",

Electronic address: lfylzc123@163.com. Estradiol (E2) is a sex steroid hormone that modulates multiple physiological processes in teleosts. The aim of this study was to explore the role of E2 in the hepatic lipid metabolism of hybrid tilapia. The hybrid tilapias were injected with different concentrations of E2 (0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) (35 mg/kg) (an E2 receptor antagonist). Subsequently, the liver lipid depositions were analyzed by tissue sections with oil red O staining. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were assayed from the fish in different groups. Genes related to very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly, lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptors, fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol metabolism were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that 50 mg/kg E2 injections enlarged the lipid droplets significantly. Simultaneously, the E2 injections tended to upregulate TC, TG, LDL, and HDL in the serum. The 50 mg/kg E2 group showed a significantly higher expression of the VLDL assembly genes but depressed levels of LDLR and LRP1. In addition, FABP3, FABP11a and DGAT2 were significantly elevated, while CD36 and ACO1 decreased in the 50 mg/kg E2 injection. The ICI injection inhibited the expression of MTP, LPL, LRP1, CD36, FABP11a, ACO1 and FAS in tilapia livers. These results demonstrated that by stimulating the expression of genes associated with the VLDL assembly, inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptor-related genes and promoting the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the TG, E2 induced deposition of lipids in the livers of hybrid tilapia. Overall, the results suggest a role for E2 in fish lipid metabolisms that provide new clues to illustrate the sex steroid function in energy metabolism in livers.",

Apigenin is one of the most common flavonoids present in numerous plants and has many beneficial effects. But whether or not apigenin may protect against alcohol-induced liver injury remains unknown. Our aim was to examine the effect and potential mechanisms. The experimental mice were given 56% erguotou wine or simultaneously given apigenin 150-300 mg/kg by gavage for 30 days. The results showed that in the apigenin-treated mice, the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and nuclear factor kappa B proteins as well as contents of hepatic malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were reduced, while the levels of hepatic reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase were increased, especially in the 300 mg/kg group. A significant change in hepatic steatosis was also observed in the apigenin 300 mg/kg group. Apigenin pretreatment could increase the expression of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 proteins, and decrease the expression of hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase proteins. These findings demonstrated that apigenin might exert a protective effect on alcohol-induced liver injury, and its mechanisms might be related to the regulations of hepatic CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and PPARα-mediated lipogenic gene expression.",

BACKGROUND: Fatty liver is an early sign of both nonalcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Ethanol feeding using a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet (LD) model which contains 35% fat to rats or mice is a well-established model for alcoholic fatty liver. However, LD diet alone can also induce fatty liver and its differential metabolic profile may be able to differentiate steatosis induced by LD versus LD plus ethanol. PURPOSE: We investigated the lipidomic differences in the livers of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats fed a pellet diet (PD), LD and liquid ethanol diet (LED) for six weeks. STUDY DESIGN: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with nonalcoholic diets PD, LD or LED (ethanol in LD) for six weeks. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)- based metabolomics. The NMR data obtained was analyzed by multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 software to compare PD versus LD and LD versus LED groups. RESULTS: PCA of the NMR spectral data of livers of both comparisons showed a clear separation of PD from LD group and LD from LED group indicating differences in lipid profiles which corresponded with changes in total lipid weights. LD showed increases for cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, cholesterol acetate and triglycerides with decreases for fatty acyl chain, diallylic and allylic protons, while the LED showed increases in esterified cholesterol, cholesterol acetate, fatty acid methyl esters, allylic protons and some triglyceride protons with decreases in free cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (PC). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that altered lipid signature or PC levels could be an indicator to differentiate between nonalcoholic versus alcoholic fatty liver.

However, its influence on hepatic lipid accumulation in alcoholic liver disease remains unclear. The present study investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency on acute alcohol-induced hepatic lipid metabolism in mice. Mice were fed with vitamin D deficient diet, in which vitamin D was depleted for 12 weeks to establish an animal model of vitamin D deficiency. Some mice were administered a single gavage of alcohol (4 g/kg bodyweight) before they were euthanized. Results show that feeding mice with vitamin D deficient diet did not induce hepatic lipid accumulation. In contrast, vitamin D deficiency markedly reduced alcohol-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) content and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency significantly attenuated alcohol-induced sterol-regulated element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c activation, which regulates genes for hepatic fatty acid (FA) and TAG synthesis, and the expression of its target genes fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and acetyl-coenzyme- A carboxylase (Acc). In addition, vitamin D deficiency alleviated alcohol-induced downregulation of hepatic nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, which governs FA transport and β-oxidation, and the expression of Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt)-1α, cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily a, polypeptide (Cyp4a)10, and Cyp4a14, which are key enzymes for hepatic fatty acids β-oxidation and ω-oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that vitamin D deficiency is not a direct risk factor for hepatic lipid accumulation. Vitamin D deficiency alleviates acute alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation through inhibiting hepatic de novo fatty acid syntheses and promoting fatty acid β-oxidation and ω-oxidation. © 2019 AOCS.",

Author information: (1)College of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. (2)Department of Preclinical Medicine, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is the most common liver disease and can progress to fatal liver cirrhosis and carcinoma, affecting millions of patients worldwide. The functions of astragaloside on the cardiovascular system have been elucidated. However, its role in AFLD is unclear. Ethanol-treated AML-12 cells were used as a cell model of alcoholic fatty liver. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting detected genes and proteins expressions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, albumin, ferritin, bilirubin, superoxide dismutase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were examined using commercial kits. Lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil red O staining. MTT and flow cytometry measured cell viability and apoptosis. JC-1 was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential. A rat model of AFLD was established by treating rats with ethanol. Astragaloside suppressed ethanol-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and the production of AST and ALT in AML-12 cells. Ethanol induced TNF-α and reduced IL-10 expression, which were reversed by astragaloside. Ethanol promoted Bax expression and cytochrome C release and inhibited Bcl-2 and ATP expression. Astragaloside hampered these apoptosis effects in AML-12 cells. Impaired mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered by astragaloside. However, all these astragaloside-mediated beneficial effects were abolished by the ROS inducer pyocyanin. Ethanol-induced activation of NF-κB signaling was suppressed by astragaloside in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that astragaloside inhibited oxidative stress by suppressing the activation of NF-κB signaling, thus improving liver function and alleviating AFLD in rats.

Author information: (1)College of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. (2)Department of Preclinical Medicine, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is the most common liver disease and can progress to fatal liver cirrhosis and carcinoma, affecting millions of patients worldwide. The functions of astragaloside on the cardiovascular system have been elucidated. However, its role in AFLD is unclear. Ethanol-treated AML-12 cells were used as a cell model of alcoholic fatty liver. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting detected genes and proteins expressions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, albumin, ferritin, bilirubin, superoxide dismutase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were examined using commercial kits. Lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil red O staining. MTT and flow cytometry measured cell viability and apoptosis. JC-1 was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential. A rat model of AFLD was established by treating rats with ethanol. Astragaloside suppressed ethanol-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and the production of AST and ALT in AML-12 cells. Ethanol induced TNF-α and reduced IL-10 expression, which were reversed by astragaloside. Ethanol promoted Bax expression and cytochrome C release and inhibited Bcl-2 and ATP expression. Astragaloside hampered these apoptosis effects in AML-12 cells. Impaired mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered by astragaloside. However, all these astragaloside-mediated beneficial effects were abolished by the ROS inducer pyocyanin. Ethanol-induced activation of NF-κB signaling was suppressed by astragaloside in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that astragaloside inhibited oxidative stress by suppressing the activation of NF-κB signaling, thus improving liver function and alleviating AFLD in rats.

Author information: (1)College of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. (2)Department of Preclinical Medicine, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is the most common liver disease and can progress to fatal liver cirrhosis and carcinoma, affecting millions of patients worldwide. The functions of astragaloside on the cardiovascular system have been elucidated. However, its role in AFLD is unclear. Ethanol-treated AML-12 cells were used as a cell model of alcoholic fatty liver. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting detected genes and proteins expressions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, albumin, ferritin, bilirubin, superoxide dismutase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were examined using commercial kits. Lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil red O staining. MTT and flow cytometry measured cell viability and apoptosis. JC-1 was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential. A rat model of AFLD was established by treating rats with ethanol. Astragaloside suppressed ethanol-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and the production of AST and ALT in AML-12 cells. Ethanol induced TNF-α and reduced IL-10 expression, which were reversed by astragaloside. Ethanol promoted Bax expression and cytochrome C release and inhibited Bcl-2 and ATP expression.

Ethanol induced TNF-α and reduced IL-10 expression, which were reversed by astragaloside. Ethanol promoted Bax expression and cytochrome C release and inhibited Bcl-2 and ATP expression. Astragaloside hampered these apoptosis effects in AML-12 cells. Impaired mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered by astragaloside. However, all these astragaloside-mediated beneficial effects were abolished by the ROS inducer pyocyanin. Ethanol-induced activation of NF-κB signaling was suppressed by astragaloside in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that astragaloside inhibited oxidative stress by suppressing the activation of NF-κB signaling, thus improving liver function and alleviating AFLD in rats. Our study elucidates the pharmacological mechanism of astragaloside and provides potential therapeutic strategies for AFLD. © 2021 The Authors.

Although SREBP-1c regulates key enzymes required for hepatic de novo lipogenesis, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of SREBP-1c in pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver is still incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of ERRγ in alcohol-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and examined the possibility to ameliorate alcoholic fatty liver through its inverse agonist. Hepatic ERRγ and SREBP-1c expression was increased by alcohol-mediated activation of CB1 receptor signaling. Deletion and mutation analyses of the Srebp-1c gene promoter showed that ERRγ directly regulates Srebp-1c gene transcription via binding to an ERR-response element. Overexpression of ERRγ significantly induced SREBP-1c expression and fat accumulation in liver of mice, which were blocked in Srebp-1c-knockout hepatocytes. Conversely, liver-specific ablation of ERRγ gene expression attenuated alcohol-mediated induction of SREBP-1c expression. Finally, an ERRγ inverse agonist, GSK5182, significantly ameliorates fatty liver disease in chronically alcohol-fed mice through inhibition of SREBP-1c-mediated fat accumulation. ERRγ mediates alcohol-induced hepatic lipogenesis by upregulating SREBP-1c expression, which can be blunted by the inverse agonist for ERRγ, which may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholic fatty liver disease in human.",

    "text": "2016 Sep;240(1):96-107. Dysregulation of hepatic cAMP levels via altered Pde4b expression plays a critical role in alcohol-induced steatosis. Avila DV(1), Barker DF(2), McClain CJ(1)(2)(3), (2), (2). Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. (2)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Louisville Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. (3)Robley Rex VA Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis is a significant risk factor for progressive liver disease. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling has been shown to significantly regulate lipid metabolism; however, the role of altered cAMP homeostasis in alcohol-mediated hepatic steatosis has never been studied. Our previous work demonstrated that increased expression of hepatic phosphodiesterase 4 (Pde4), which specifically hydrolyses and decreases cAMP levels, plays a pathogenic role in the development of liver inflammation/injury. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PDE4 in alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. C57BL/6 wild-type and Pde4b knockout (Pde4b(-/-) ) mice were pair-fed control or ethanol liquid diets. One group of wild-type mice received rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor, during alcohol feeding. We demonstrate for the first time that an early increase in PDE4 enzyme expression and a resultant decrease in hepatic cAMP levels are associated with the significant reduction in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) expression. Notably, alcohol-fed (AF) Pde4b(-/-) mice and AF wild-type mice treated with rolipram had significantly lower hepatic free fatty acid content compared with AF wild-type mice. Importantly, PDE4 inhibition in alcohol-fed mice prevented the decrease in hepatic Cpt1a expression via the Pparα/Sirt1/Pgc1α pathway. These results demonstrate that the alcohol- induced increase in hepatic Pde4, specifically Pde4b expression, and compromised cAMP signalling predispose the liver to impaired fatty acid oxidation and the development of steatosis. Moreover, these data also suggest that hepatic PDE4 may be a clinically relevant therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis.

(2)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Louisville Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. (3)Robley Rex VA Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis is a significant risk factor for progressive liver disease. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling has been shown to significantly regulate lipid metabolism; however, the role of altered cAMP homeostasis in alcohol-mediated hepatic steatosis has never been studied. Our previous work demonstrated that increased expression of hepatic phosphodiesterase 4 (Pde4), which specifically hydrolyses and decreases cAMP levels, plays a pathogenic role in the development of liver inflammation/injury. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PDE4 in alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. C57BL/6 wild-type and Pde4b knockout (Pde4b(-/-) ) mice were pair-fed control or ethanol liquid diets. One group of wild-type mice received rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor, during alcohol feeding. We demonstrate for the first time that an early increase in PDE4 enzyme expression and a resultant decrease in hepatic cAMP levels are associated with the significant reduction in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) expression. Notably, alcohol-fed (AF) Pde4b(-/-) mice and AF wild-type mice treated with rolipram had significantly lower hepatic free fatty acid content compared with AF wild-type mice. Importantly, PDE4 inhibition in alcohol-fed mice prevented the decrease in hepatic Cpt1a expression via the Pparα/Sirt1/Pgc1α pathway. These results demonstrate that the alcohol- induced increase in hepatic Pde4, specifically Pde4b expression, and compromised cAMP signalling predispose the liver to impaired fatty acid oxidation and the development of steatosis. Moreover, these data also suggest that hepatic PDE4 may be a clinically relevant therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis.

Excessive alcohol consumption causes the cellular and tissue damage. The toxic metabolites of ethanol are harmful to multiple organ systems, such as the central nervous system, skeletal muscles, and liver, and cause alcohol-induced diseases like cancer, as well as induce hepatotoxicity, and alcoholic myopathy. Alcohol exposure leads to a surge in hepatic alcohol metabolism and oxygen consumption, a decrease in hepatic ATP, and the rapid accumulation of lipid within hepatocytes. Several pathologies are closely linked to defective mitochondrial dynamics triggered by abnormal mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, raising the possibility that novel drugs targeting mitochondrial dynamics may have therapeutic potential in restoring cellular homeostasis in ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Rutin is a phytochemical polyphenol known to protect cells from cytotoxic chemicals. We investigated the effects of rutin on mitochondrial dynamics induced by ethanol. We found that rutin enhances mitochondrial dynamics by suppressing mitochondrial fission and restoring the balance of the mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial elongation following rutin treatment of ethanol exposed cells was accompanied by reduced DRP1 expression. These data suggest that rutin plays an important role in remodeling of mitochondrial dynamics to alleviate hepatic steatosis and enhance mitochondrial function and cell viability. © 2021 The Author(s).

Obesogenic lipids and the sphingolipid ceramide have been implicated as potential cofactors in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients. However, the mechanisms by which these lipids modulate lipid trafficking in ethanol-treated human liver cells to promote steatosis, an early stage of ALD, are poorly understood. We measured fatty acid (FA) uptake, triglyceride export, FA synthesis and FA oxidation in human hepatoma (VL-17A) cells in response to ethanol and the exogenous lipids oleate, palmitate and C2 ceramide. We found that in combination with ethanol, both oleate and palmitate promote lipid droplet accumulation while C2 ceramide inhibits lipid droplet accumulation by enhancing FA oxidation. Further, using both a pharmacologic and siRNA approach to reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α (PPARα) gene expression, we demonstrate that C2 ceramide abrogates ethanol-mediated suppression of FA oxidation through an indirect PPARα mechanism. Together, these data suggest that lipids interact differentially with ethanol to modulate hepatocellular lipid droplet accumulation and may provide novel targets for preventing the earliest stage of alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic steatosis.

Dig Med Res. 2018 Sep;1:16. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Defects in lysosome function and autophagy contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. We investigated the mechanisms by which alcohol consumption affects these processes by evaluating the functions of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which regulates lysosomal biogenesis. METHODS: We performed studies with GFP-LC3 mice, mice with liver-specific deletion of TFEB, mice with disruption of the transcription factor E3 gene (TFE3-knockout mice), mice with disruption of the Tefb and Tfe3 genes (TFEB and TFE3 double-knockout mice), and Tfebflox/flox albumin cre-negative mice (controls). TFEB was overexpressed from adenoviral vectors or knocked down with small interfering RNAs in mouse livers. Mice were placed on diets of regular ethanol feeding plus an acute binge to induce liver damage (ethanol diet); some mice also were given injections of torin-1, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to monitor lysosome biogenesis. We analyzed levels of TFEB in liver tissues from patients with alcoholic hepatitis and from healthy donors (controls) by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Liver tissues from mice on the ethanol diet had lower levels of total and nuclear TFEB compared with control mice, and hepatocytes had decreased lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Hepatocytes from mice on the ethanol diet had increased translocation of mTOR into lysosomes, resulting in increased mTOR activation. Administration of torin-1 increased liver levels of TFEB and decreased steatosis and liver injury induced by ethanol. Mice that overexpressed TFEB in the liver developed less severe ethanol-induced liver injury and had increased lysosomal biogenesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics compared with mice carrying a control vector. Mice with knockdown of TFEB and TFEB-TFE3 double-knockout mice developed more severe liver injury in response to the ethanol diet than control mice. Liver tissues from patients with alcohol-induced hepatitis had lower nuclear levels of TFEB than control tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ethanol feeding plus an acute binge decreased hepatic expression of TFEB, which is required for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Strategies to block mTOR activity or increase levels of TFEB might be developed to protect the liver from ethanol-induced damage.

Dig Med Res. 2018 Sep;1:16. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Defects in lysosome function and autophagy contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. We investigated the mechanisms by which alcohol consumption affects these processes by evaluating the functions of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which regulates lysosomal biogenesis. METHODS: We performed studies with GFP-LC3 mice, mice with liver-specific deletion of TFEB, mice with disruption of the transcription factor E3 gene (TFE3-knockout mice), mice with disruption of the Tefb and Tfe3 genes (TFEB and TFE3 double-knockout mice), and Tfebflox/flox albumin cre-negative mice (controls). TFEB was overexpressed from adenoviral vectors or knocked down with small interfering RNAs in mouse livers. Mice were placed on diets of regular ethanol feeding plus an acute binge to induce liver damage (ethanol diet); some mice also were given injections of torin-1, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to monitor lysosome biogenesis. We analyzed levels of TFEB in liver tissues from patients with alcoholic hepatitis and from healthy donors (controls) by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Liver tissues from mice on the ethanol diet had lower levels of total and nuclear TFEB compared with control mice, and hepatocytes had decreased lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Hepatocytes from mice on the ethanol diet had increased translocation of mTOR into lysosomes, resulting in increased mTOR activation. Administration of torin-1 increased liver levels of TFEB and decreased steatosis and liver injury induced by ethanol. Mice that overexpressed TFEB in the liver developed less severe ethanol-induced liver injury and had increased lysosomal biogenesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics compared with mice carrying a control vector. Mice with knockdown of TFEB and TFEB-TFE3 double-knockout mice developed more severe liver injury in response to the ethanol diet than control mice. Liver tissues from patients with alcohol-induced hepatitis had lower nuclear levels of TFEB than control tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ethanol feeding plus an acute binge decreased hepatic expression of TFEB, which is required for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Strategies to block mTOR activity or increase levels of TFEB might be developed to protect the liver from ethanol-induced damage.

Electronic address: luy004@etsu.edu. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5) is induced by ethanol, and the ethanol induction of CYP2A5 is regulated by nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Cyp2a5 knockout (Cyp2a5-/-) mice develop more severe alcoholic fatty liver than Cyp2a5+/+ mice. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a PPARα-regulated liver hormone, is involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver are enhanced in Pparα knockout (Pparα-/-) mice. This study investigates the relationship between the PPARα-FGF21 axis and the enhanced alcoholic fatty liver in Cyp2a5-/- mice. METHODS: Mice were fed the Lieber-Decarli ethanol diet to induce alcoholic fatty liver. RESULTS: More severe alcoholic fatty liver disease was developed in Cyp2a5-/- mice than in Cyp2a5+/+ mice. Basal FGF21 levels were higher in Cyp2a5-/- mice than in Cyp2a5+/+ mice, but ethanol did not further increase the elevated FGF21 levels in Cyp2a5-/- mice while FGF21 was induced by ethanol in Cyp2a5+/+ mice. Basal levels of serum FGF21 were lower in Pparα-/- mice than in Pparα+/+ mice; ethanol induced FGF21 in Pparα+/+ mice but not in Pparα-/- mice, whereas ethanol induced hypertriglyceridemia in Pparα-/- mice but not in Pparα+/+ mice. Administration of recombinant FGF21 normalized serum FGF21 and triglyceride in Pparα-/- mice. Alcoholic fatty liver was enhanced in liver-specific Fgf21 knockout mice. Pparα and Cyp2a5 double knockout (Pparα-/-/Cyp2a5-/-) mice developed more severe alcoholic fatty liver than Pparα+/+/Cyp2a5-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CYP2A5 protects against the development of alcoholic fatty liver disease, and the PPARα-FGF21 axis contributes to the protective effects of CYP2A5 on alcoholic fatty liver disease.

(2)Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, NC 28081, USA. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is characterized by accumulation of hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and liver injury. The present study aimed to investigate if mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a role in FFA-induced organelle dysfunction, thereby contributing to the development of ALD. Cell studies were conducted to define the causal role and underlying mechanism of FFA-activated mTORC1 signaling in hepatocellular cell injury. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were subjected to chronic alcohol feeding with or without rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 activation. We revealed that palmitic acid (PA)-induced ER stress and suppression of LAMP2 and autophagy flux were mTORC1-dependent as rapamycin reversed such deleterious effects. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was downstream of ATF4 which partially modulated LAMP2. Supplementation with rapamycin to alcohol-fed mice attenuated mTORC1 activation and ER stress, restored LAMP2 protein, and improved autophagy, leading to amelioration of alcohol-induced liver injury. Induction of mTORC1 signaling and CHOP were also detected in the liver of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. This study demonstrates that hepatic FFAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD by activating mTORC1 signaling, thereby inducing ER stress and suppressing LAMP2-autophagy flux pathway, which represents an important mechanism of FFA-induced hepatocellular injury.

(2)Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, NC 28081, USA. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is characterized by accumulation of hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and liver injury. The present study aimed to investigate if mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a role in FFA-induced organelle dysfunction, thereby contributing to the development of ALD. Cell studies were conducted to define the causal role and underlying mechanism of FFA-activated mTORC1 signaling in hepatocellular cell injury. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were subjected to chronic alcohol feeding with or without rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 activation. We revealed that palmitic acid (PA)-induced ER stress and suppression of LAMP2 and autophagy flux were mTORC1-dependent as rapamycin reversed such deleterious effects. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was downstream of ATF4 which partially modulated LAMP2. Supplementation with rapamycin to alcohol-fed mice attenuated mTORC1 activation and ER stress, restored LAMP2 protein, and improved autophagy, leading to amelioration of alcohol-induced liver injury. Induction of mTORC1 signaling and CHOP were also detected in the liver of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. This study demonstrates that hepatic FFAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD by activating mTORC1 signaling, thereby inducing ER stress and suppressing LAMP2-autophagy flux pathway, which represents an important mechanism of FFA-induced hepatocellular injury.

However, how chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic lipid accumulation remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a causal role in alcoholic steatosis, inflammation, and liver injury. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinase S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in hepatocytes. Aberrant activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the defects of the DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the liver of chronic-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice and in the liver of patients with ALD. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of hepatic DEPTOR suppressed mTORC1 signaling and ameliorated alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation, and acute-on-chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, the lipid-lowering effect of hepatic DEPTOR was attributable to decreased proteolytic processing, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). DEPTOR-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 also attenuated alcohol-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of the lipogenic regulator lipin 1 and prevented alcohol-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Pharmacological intervention with rapamycin alleviated the ability of alcohol to up-regulate lipogenesis, to down-regulate fatty acid oxidation, and to induce steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to activation of SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 disrupted DEPTOR function, enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver, inflammation, and liver injury in mice. CONCLUSION: The dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1 signaling is a critical determinant of ALD pathology; targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR and selectively inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential for treating ALD in humans.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ginsenosides from stems and leaves of ginseng on ethanol-induced lipid deposition in human L02 hepatocytes. METHODS: L02 cells were exposed to ethanol for 36 h and treated with or without ginsenosides. The viability of L02 cells was evaluated by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and the triglyceride (TG) content was detected. Lipid droplets were determined by oil red O staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the mitochondrial membrane potential were tested by flow cytometry. The ATP level was measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of cytochrome p450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Ethanol exposure resulted in the increase of TG level, lipid accumulation and ROS generation, and the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in the cells. However, ginsenosides significantly reduced TG content (9.69±0.22 μg/mg protein vs. 4.93±0.49 μg/mg protein, P<0.01), and ROS formation (7254.8±385.7 vs. 5825.2±375.9, P<0.01). Meanwhile, improvements in mitochondrial membrane potential (10655.33±331.34 vs. 11129.52±262.35, P<0.05) and ATP level (1.20±0.18 nmol/mg protein vs. 2.53±0.25 nmol/mg protein, P<0.01) were observed by treatment with ginsenosides. Furthermore, ginsenosides could down-regulate CYP2E1 expression (P<0.01) and upregulate PPARα expression (P<0.01) in ethanol-treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenosides could prevent ethanol-induced hepatocyte steatosis in vitro related to the inhibition of oxidative stress and the improvement of mitochondrial function. In addition, the modulation of CYP2E1 and PPARα expression may also play an important role in the protective effect of ginsenosides against lipid accumulation.",

Background: Inflammation and steatosis are the main pathological features of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), in which, inflammation is one of the critical drivers for the initiation and development of alcoholic steatosis. NIK, an inflammatory pathway component activated by inflammatory cytokines, was suspected to link inflammation to hepatic steatosis during ALD. However, the underlying pathogenesis is not well-elucidated. Methods: Alcoholic steatosis was induced in mice by chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Both the loss- and gain-of-function experiments by the hepatocyte-specific deletion, pharmacological inhibition and adenoviral transfection of NIK were utilized to elucidate the role of NIK in alcoholic steatosis. Rate of fatty acid oxidation was assessed in vivo and in vitro. PPARα agonists or antagonists of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were used to identify the NIK-induced regulation of PPARα, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. The potential interactions between NIK, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and PPARα and the phosphorylation of PPARα were clarified by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and far-western blotting analysis. Results: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of NIK protected mice from alcoholic steatosis by sustaining hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, overexpression of NIK contributed to hepatic lipid accumulation with disrupted fatty acid oxidation. The pathological effect of NIK in ALD may be attributed to the suppression of PPARα, the main controller of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, because PPARα agonists reversed NIK-mediated hepatic steatosis and malfunction of fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, NIK recruited MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to form a complex that catalyzed the inhibitory phosphorylation of PPARα. Importantly, pharmacological intervention against NIK significantly attenuated alcoholic steatosis in ethanol-fed mice. Conclusions: NIK targeting PPARα via MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 disrupts hepatic fatty acid oxidation and exhibits high value in ALD therapy. © The author(s).

Background: Inflammation and steatosis are the main pathological features of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), in which, inflammation is one of the critical drivers for the initiation and development of alcoholic steatosis. NIK, an inflammatory pathway component activated by inflammatory cytokines, was suspected to link inflammation to hepatic steatosis during ALD. However, the underlying pathogenesis is not well-elucidated. Methods: Alcoholic steatosis was induced in mice by chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Both the loss- and gain-of-function experiments by the hepatocyte-specific deletion, pharmacological inhibition and adenoviral transfection of NIK were utilized to elucidate the role of NIK in alcoholic steatosis. Rate of fatty acid oxidation was assessed in vivo and in vitro. PPARα agonists or antagonists of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were used to identify the NIK-induced regulation of PPARα, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. The potential interactions between NIK, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and PPARα and the phosphorylation of PPARα were clarified by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and far-western blotting analysis. Results: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of NIK protected mice from alcoholic steatosis by sustaining hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, overexpression of NIK contributed to hepatic lipid accumulation with disrupted fatty acid oxidation. The pathological effect of NIK in ALD may be attributed to the suppression of PPARα, the main controller of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, because PPARα agonists reversed NIK-mediated hepatic steatosis and malfunction of fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, NIK recruited MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to form a complex that catalyzed the inhibitory phosphorylation of PPARα. Importantly, pharmacological intervention against NIK significantly attenuated alcoholic steatosis in ethanol-fed mice. Conclusions: NIK targeting PPARα via MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 disrupts hepatic fatty acid oxidation and exhibits high value in ALD therapy. © The author(s).

Hepatic steatosis is the most distinctive feature of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Our previous in vivo study showed that ligustrazine, a major active alkaloid isolated from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and in vitro study revealed that nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation might be a prerequisite. This study was aimed to explore the in vivo function of Nrf2 in the protective effect of ligustrazine and illustrate downstream mechanisms. Nrf2 shRNA lentivirus was introduced to establish Nrf2-knockdown mice. Results showed that Nrf2 knockdown aggravated alcoholic liver injury and abolished the protective effect of ligustrazine, evidenced by elevated serum biomarkers and severe liver inflammation. Ligustrazine impressively ameliorated hepatic steatosis through inhibiting hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and inducing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, which was abrogated by Nrf2 knockdown. Noteworthily, Nrf2 knockdown apparently reinforced the inductive effect of alcohol on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). Ligustrazine weakened the stimulation of alcohol on HIF-1α expression, which was abrogated by Nrf2 shRNA lentivirus. Consistent results were obtained from in vitro study, implying that Nrf2/HIF-1α pathway participated in the modulation of ligustrazine. Gain- or loss-of-function analyses further revealed that Nrf2 siRNA and dimethyloxalylglycine, a HIF-1α agonist, abolished the inhibitory effect of ligustrazine, whereas HIF-1α siRNA mimicked the role of ligustrazine and even rescued the inhibitory effect of ligustrazine on ethanol-induced lipid accumulation in Nrf2-knockdown hepatocytes. Taken together, we concluded that ligustrazine attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis via a Nrf2/HIF-1α pathway-dependent mechanism. © The Author 2016.

Our investigations into the corresponding mechanisms demonstrated that the ameliorating effect of FO might be associated with the lower endoplasmic reticulum stress and normalized lipid metabolism in adipose tissue.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the hepatoprotective mechanisms of fish oil in ethanol-fed rats based on lipid metabolism. Thirty eight-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: C (control), CF25 (control diet with 25% fish oil substitution), CF57 (control diet with 57% fish oil substitution), E (ethanol-containing diet) group, EF25 (ethanol-containing diet with 25% fish oil substitution), and EF57 (ethanol-containing diet with 57% fish oil substitution) groups. All of the groups were pair-fed an isoenergetic diet based on E group. Rats were sacrificed after eight weeks. When compared with C group, the plasma aspartate transaminase (AST) activity and hepatic steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly higher, while plasma adiponectin level and hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase &alpha; (AMPK&alpha;) protein expression was significantly lower in the E group. However, the hepatic damage, including steatosis and inflammation were ameliorated in the EF25 and EF57 groups. Moreover, mRNA levels of fatty acid-oxidative enzymes, such as medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1) were significantly elevated in the EF57 group than those in E group. Partial replacement with fish oil might improve the fatty acid oxidation by raising mRNA levels of downstream transcription factors, finally inhibit the ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis in rats.

Ethanol (EtOH) metabolism itself can be a predisposing factor for initiation of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Therefore, a dose dependent study to evaluate liver injury was conducted in hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) deficient (ADH-) and ADH normal (ADH+) deer mice fed 1%, 2% or 3.5% EtOH in the liquid diet daily for 2 months. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC), liver injury marker (alanine amino transferase (ALT)), hepatic lipids and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity were measured. Liver histology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and cell death proteins were evaluated. Significantly increased BAC, plasma ALT, hepatic lipids and steatosis were found only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Further, a significant ER stress and increased un-spliced X-box binding protein 1 were evident only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Both strains fed 3.5% EtOH showed deactivation of AMPK, but increased acetyl Co-A carboxylase 1 and decreased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A favoring lipogenesis were found only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Therefore, irrespective of CYP2E1 overexpression; EtOH dose and hepatic ADH deficiency contribute to EtOH-induced steatosis and liver injury, suggesting a linkage between ER stress, dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism and AMPK signaling.

Ethanol (EtOH) metabolism itself can be a predisposing factor for initiation of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Therefore, a dose dependent study to evaluate liver injury was conducted in hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) deficient (ADH-) and ADH normal (ADH+) deer mice fed 1%, 2% or 3.5% EtOH in the liquid diet daily for 2 months. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC), liver injury marker (alanine amino transferase (ALT)), hepatic lipids and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity were measured. Liver histology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and cell death proteins were evaluated. Significantly increased BAC, plasma ALT, hepatic lipids and steatosis were found only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Further, a significant ER stress and increased un-spliced X-box binding protein 1 were evident only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Both strains fed 3.5% EtOH showed deactivation of AMPK, but increased acetyl Co-A carboxylase 1 and decreased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A favoring lipogenesis were found only in ADH- deer mice fed 3.5% EtOH. Therefore, irrespective of CYP2E1 overexpression; EtOH dose and hepatic ADH deficiency contribute to EtOH-induced steatosis and liver injury, suggesting a linkage between ER stress, dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism and AMPK signaling.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), a condition caused by alcohol overconsumption, occurs in three stages of liver injury including steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. DEP domain-containing protein 5 (DEPDC5), a component of GAP activities towards Rags 1 (GATOR1) complex, is a repressor of amino acid-sensing branch of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. In the current study, we found that aberrant activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the reduction of DEPDC5 in the livers of ethanol-fed mice or ALD patients. To further define the in vivo role of DEPDC5 in ALD development, we generated Depdc5 hepatocyte-specific knockout mouse model (Depdc5-LKO) in which mTORC1 pathway was constitutively activated through loss of the inhibitory effect of GATOR1. Hepatic Depdc5 ablation leads to mild hepatomegaly and liver injury and protects against diet-induced liver steatosis. In contrast, ethanol-fed Depdc5-LKO mice developed severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Pharmacological intervention with Torin 1 suppressed mTORC1 activity and remarkably ameliorated ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both control and Depdc5-LKO mice. The pathological effect of sustained mTORC1 activity in ALD may be attributed to the suppression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), the master regulator of fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, because fenofibrate (PPARα agonist) treatment reverses ethanol-induced liver steatosis and inflammation in Depdc5-LKO mice. These findings provide novel insights into the in vivo role of hepatic DEPDC5 in the development of ALD. © 2021. The Author(s).

To further define the in vivo role of DEPDC5 in ALD development, we generated Depdc5 hepatocyte-specific knockout mouse model (Depdc5-LKO) in which mTORC1 pathway was constitutively activated through loss of the inhibitory effect of GATOR1. Hepatic Depdc5 ablation leads to mild hepatomegaly and liver injury and protects against diet-induced liver steatosis. In contrast, ethanol-fed Depdc5-LKO mice developed severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Pharmacological intervention with Torin 1 suppressed mTORC1 activity and remarkably ameliorated ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both control and Depdc5-LKO mice. The pathological effect of sustained mTORC1 activity in ALD may be attributed to the suppression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), the master regulator of fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, because fenofibrate (PPARα agonist) treatment reverses ethanol-induced liver steatosis and inflammation in Depdc5-LKO mice. These findings provide novel insights into the in vivo role of hepatic DEPDC5 in the development of ALD. © 2021. The Author(s).

(2)Division of Peptides Related with Human Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Chengdu, Sichuan 610000, P.R. China. Betaine has previously been demonstrated to protect the liver against alcohol‑induced fat accumulation. However, the mechanism through which betaine affects alcohol‑induced hepatic lipid metabolic disorders has not been extensively studied. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of betaine on alcoholic simple fatty liver and hepatic lipid metabolism disorders. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Liver function, morphological alterations, lipid content and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α levels were determined. Hepatic expression levels of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1, DGAT2, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)‑1c, SREBP‑2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methyl‑glutaryl (HMG)‑CoA reductase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor λ coactivator (PGC)‑1α, adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) 1 and AdipoR2 were quantified. Serum and adipose tissue adiponectin levels were assessed using an enzyme‑linked immunoassay. The results demonstrated that alcohol‑induced ultramicrostructural alterations in hepatocytes, including the presence of lipid droplets and swollen mitochondria, were attenuated by betaine. Hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and cholesterol ester contents and the expression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, SREBP‑2, FAS and HMG‑CoA reductase were increased following ethanol consumption, however were maintained at control levels following betaine supplementation. Alcohol‑induced decreases in hepatic PGC‑1α mRNA levels and serum and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations were prevented by betaine. The downregulation of hepatic AdipoR1 which resulted from alcohol exposure was partially attenuated by betaine. No significant differences in liver function, TNF‑α, phospholipid and AdipoR2 levels were observed among the control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Overall, these results indicated that betaine attenuated the alcoholic simple fatty liver by improving hepatic lipid metabolism via suppression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, FAS, SREBP‑2 and HMG‑CoA reductase and upregulation of PGC‑1α.

An estimated 90% of heavy drinkers are thought to develop significant liver steatosis. For these reasons, an increased understanding of the molecular basis for alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis is important. It has become clear that autophagy, a catabolic process of intracellular degradation and recycling, plays a key role in hepatic lipid metabolism. We have shown that Rab7, a small guanosine triphosphatase known to regulate membrane trafficking, acts as a key orchestrator of hepatocellular lipophagy, a selective form of autophagy in which lipid droplets (LDs) are specifically targeted for turnover by the autophagic machinery. Nutrient starvation results in Rab7 activation on the surface of the LD and lysosomal compartments, resulting in the mobilization of triglycerides stored within the LDs for energy production. Here, we examine whether the steatotic effects of alcohol exposure are a result of perturbations to the Rab7-mediated lipophagic pathway. Rats chronically fed an ethanol-containing diet accumulated significantly higher levels of fat in their hepatocytes. Interestingly, hepatocytes isolated from these ethanol-fed rats contained juxtanuclear lysosomes that exhibited impaired motility. These changes are similar to those we observed in Rab7-depleted hepatocytes. Consistent with these defects in the lysosomal compartment, we observed a marked 80% reduction in Rab7 activity in cultured hepatocytes as well as a complete block in starvation-induced Rab7 activation in primary hepatocytes isolated from chronic ethanol-fed animals. Conclusion: A mechanism is supported whereby ethanol exposure inhibits Rab7 activity, resulting in the impaired transport, targeting, and fusion of the autophagic machinery with LDs, leading to an accumulation of hepatocellular lipids and hepatic steatosis.

Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) plays important roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis, and impairment of Akt activity has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL). We hypothesized that Akt activity might be impaired due to CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. In this study, we found that chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis was accompanied with reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in mice liver. Chronic ethanol exposure had no effects on the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), and led to a slight decrease of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) protein level. Ethanol exposure resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-Akt adducts, which was significantly inhibited by chlormethiazole (CMZ), an efficient CYP2E1 inhibitor. Interestingly, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated chronic ethanol-induced hepatic fat accumulation and the decline of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. In the in vitro studies, Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 (CYP2E1-HepG2) cells compared with the negative control HepG2 (NC-HepG2) cells, and 4-HNE treatment led to significant decrease of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in wild type HepG2 cells. Lastly, pharmacological activation of Akt by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) significantly alleviated chronic ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice. Collectively, these results indicate that CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for ethanol-induced suppression of Akt phosphorylation and pharmacological modulation of Akt in liver may be an effective strategy for the treatment of ethanol-induced fatty liver.

Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) plays important roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis, and impairment of Akt activity has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL). We hypothesized that Akt activity might be impaired due to CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. In this study, we found that chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis was accompanied with reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in mice liver. Chronic ethanol exposure had no effects on the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), and led to a slight decrease of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) protein level. Ethanol exposure resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-Akt adducts, which was significantly inhibited by chlormethiazole (CMZ), an efficient CYP2E1 inhibitor. Interestingly, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated chronic ethanol-induced hepatic fat accumulation and the decline of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. In the in vitro studies, Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 (CYP2E1-HepG2) cells compared with the negative control HepG2 (NC-HepG2) cells, and 4-HNE treatment led to significant decrease of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in wild type HepG2 cells. Lastly, pharmacological activation of Akt by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) significantly alleviated chronic ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice. Collectively, these results indicate that CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for ethanol-induced suppression of Akt phosphorylation and pharmacological modulation of Akt in liver may be an effective strategy for the treatment of ethanol-induced fatty liver.

Alcoholic liver disease is a significant contributor to global liver failure. In murine models, chronic ethanol consumption dysregulates PTEN/Akt signaling. Hepatospecific deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTENLKO) mice possess constitutive activation of Akt(s) and increased de novo lipogenesis resulting in increased hepatocellular steatosis. This makes PTENLKO a viable model to examine the effects of ethanol in an environment of preexisting steatosis. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of chronic ethanol consumption and the absence of PTEN (PTENLKO) compared to Alb-Cre control mice (PTENf/f) on hepatocellular damage as evidenced by changes in lipid accumulation, protein carbonylation and alanine amino transferase (ALT). In the control PTENf/f animals, ethanol significantly increased ALT, liver triglycerides and steatosis. In contrast, chronic ethanol consumption in PTENLKO mice decreased hepatocellular damage when compared to PTENLKO pair-fed controls. Consumption of ethanol elevated protein carbonylation in PTENf/f animals but had no effect in PTENLKO animals. In PTENLKO mice, overall hepatic mRNA expression of genes that contribute to GSH homeostasis as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations were significantly elevated compared to respective PTENf/f counterparts. These data indicate that during conditions of constitutive Akt activation and steatosis, increased GSH homeostasis assists in mitigation of ethanol-dependent induction of oxidative stress and hepatocellular damage. Furthermore, data herein suggest a divergence in EtOH-induced hepatocellular damage and increases in steatosis due to polyunsaturated fatty acids downstream of PTEN.

Author information: (1)Center for Translational Biomedical Research, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina. (2)Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina. BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling has been shown to regulate lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Previous studies have shown that hepatic PPARγ is up-regulated in steatotic liver of both animal and human. However, the effects of hepatic PPARγ signaling on alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remain elusive. METHODS: To determine the role of hepatic PPARγ signaling on ALD, wild-type (WT) and hepatocyte-specific PPARγ knockdown (PPARγ∆Hep) mice were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin control liquid diet for 8 weeks to induce ALD. Blood parameters, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation were measured after 8-week alcohol feeding. RESULTS: Alcohol feeding to WT mice resulted in liver damage (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], 94.68 ± 17.05 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 55.87 ± 11.29 U/L), which was significantly alleviated by hepatic PPARγ knockdown (ALT, 57.36 ± 14.98 U/L; AST, 38.06 ± 3.35 U/L). Alcohol feeding led to marked lipid accumulation and up-regulation of lipogenic genes including fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), lipin1 (LIPIN1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) in the livers of WT mice. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ significantly alleviated alcohol-induced lipid accumulation and abolished the up-regulation of FASN, DGAT1, and DGAT2. Silencing of PPARγ in FL83B cells significantly decreased ethanol (EtOH)-, linoleic acid-, and EtOH plus linoleic acid-induced lipid accumulation. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ also significantly reduced alcohol-induced inflammatory chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP1], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]) and inflammatory infiltration (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G], and F4/80). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that hepatic PPARγ signaling contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury by promoting hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ also significantly reduced alcohol-induced inflammatory chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP1], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]) and inflammatory infiltration (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G], and F4/80). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that hepatic PPARγ signaling contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury by promoting hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has been shown to exert beneficial effects against insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg levonorgestrel; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free fatty acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment.

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Author information: (1)Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. (2)Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. (3)Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology, Basel, Switzerland. Impairment of hepatic fatty acid metabolism can lead to liver steatosis and injury. Testing drugs for interference with hepatic fatty acid metabolism is therefore important. To find out whether HepG2 cells are suitable for this purpose, we investigated the effect of three established fatty acid metabolism inhibitors and of three test compounds on triglyceride accumulation, palmitate metabolism, the acylcarnitine pool and dicarboxylic acid accumulation in the cell supernatant and on ApoB-100 excretion in HepG2 cells. The three established inhibitors [etomoxir, methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA)] depleted mitochondrial ATP at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. They inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or lower concentrations than ATP depletion, and 4-BCA was associated with cellular fat accumulation. They caused specific changes in the acylcarnitine pattern and etomoxir an increase of thapsic (C18 dicarboxylic) acid in the cell supernatant, and did not interfere with ApoB-100 excretion (marker of VLDL export). The three test compounds (amiodarone, tamoxifen, and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2) depleted the cellular ATP content at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred. They all caused cellular fat accumulation and inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or higher concentrations than ATP depletion. They suppressed medium-chain acylcarnitines in the cell supernatant and amiodarone and tamoxifen impaired thapsic acid production. Tamoxifen and WIN 55,212-2 decreased cellular ApoB-100 excretion. In conclusion, the established inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism caused the expected effects in HepG2 cells. HepG cells proved to be useful for the detection of drug-associated toxicities on hepatocellular fatty acid metabolism. PMCID: PMC5924803",

Electronic address: mkleinert@nexs.ku.dk. Excessive circulating FAs have been proposed to promote insulin resistance (IR) of glucose metabolism by increasing the oxidation of FAs over glucose. Therefore, inhibition of FA oxidation (FAOX) has been suggested to ameliorate IR. However, prolonged inhibition of FAOX would presumably cause lipid accumulation and thereby promote lipotoxicity. To understand the glycemic consequences of acute and prolonged FAOX inhibition, we treated mice with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) inhibitor, etomoxir (eto), in combination with short-term 45% high fat diet feeding to increase FA availability. Eto acutely increased glucose oxidation and peripheral glucose disposal, and lowered circulating glucose, but this was associated with increased circulating FAs and triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and heart within hours. Several days of FAOX inhibition by daily eto administration induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance, specific to CPT-1 inhibition by eto. Lower whole-body insulin sensitivity was accompanied by reduction in brown adipose tissue (BAT) uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein content, diminished BAT glucose clearance, and increased hepatic glucose production. Collectively, these data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of FAOX is not a viable strategy to treat IR, and that sufficient rates of FAOX are required for maintaining liver and BAT metabolic function.

Electronic address: mkleinert@nexs.ku.dk. Excessive circulating FAs have been proposed to promote insulin resistance (IR) of glucose metabolism by increasing the oxidation of FAs over glucose. Therefore, inhibition of FA oxidation (FAOX) has been suggested to ameliorate IR. However, prolonged inhibition of FAOX would presumably cause lipid accumulation and thereby promote lipotoxicity. To understand the glycemic consequences of acute and prolonged FAOX inhibition, we treated mice with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) inhibitor, etomoxir (eto), in combination with short-term 45% high fat diet feeding to increase FA availability. Eto acutely increased glucose oxidation and peripheral glucose disposal, and lowered circulating glucose, but this was associated with increased circulating FAs and triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and heart within hours. Several days of FAOX inhibition by daily eto administration induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance, specific to CPT-1 inhibition by eto. Lower whole-body insulin sensitivity was accompanied by reduction in brown adipose tissue (BAT) uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein content, diminished BAT glucose clearance, and increased hepatic glucose production. Collectively, these data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of FAOX is not a viable strategy to treat IR, and that sufficient rates of FAOX are required for maintaining liver and BAT metabolic function.

Fluoxetine is a first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor widely applied for the treatment of depression; however, it induces abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism. Considering decreased expression or function of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, or the upregulation of fatty acid uptake, causes hepatic lipid accumulation. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether G6Pase regulation and fatty acid uptake alteration contribute to fluoxetine-induced abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism. Our study revealed that 8-week oral administration of fluoxetine dose-dependently increased hepatic triglyceride, causing hepatic steatosis. Concomitantly, the expression of G6Pase in mouse livers and primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) was downregulated in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, fluoxetine increased the concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase substrate) and acetyl CoA (the substrate for de novo lipogenesis) in mouse livers. Additionally, fluoxetine also induced lipid accumulation and downregulated G6Pase expression in HepG2 cells. However, the uptake of green fluorescent fatty acid (BODIPY™ FL C16) in PMHs was not changed after fluoxetine treatment, indicating that fluoxetine-induced hepatic steatosis was not associated with fatty acid uptake alteration. In conclusion, fluoxetine downregulated hepatic G6Pase expression, subsequently enhanced the transformation of glucose to lipid, and ultimately resulted in hepatic steatosis, but with no impact on fatty acid uptake. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Holloway AC(1). Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders are often managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. Fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant, is widely used as a first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, fluoxetine has also been shown to increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fluoxetine has been shown to increase hepatic lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro. In addition, fluoxetine has been shown to alter the production of prostaglandins which have also been implicated in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of fluoxetine exposure on the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway and lipid accumulation in a hepatic cell line (H4-II-E-C3 cells). Fluoxetine treatment increased mRNA expression of prostaglandin biosynthetic enzymes (Ptgs1, Ptgs2, and Ptgds), PPAR gamma (Pparg), and PPAR gamma downstream targets involved in fatty acid uptake (Cd36, Fatp2, and Fatp5) as well as production of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 a PPAR gamma ligand. The effects of fluoxetine to induce lipid accumulation were attenuated with a PTGS1 specific inhibitor (SC-560), whereas inhibition of PTGS2 had no effect. Moreover, SC-560 attenuated 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 production and expression of PPAR gamma downstream target genes. Taken together these results suggest that fluoxetine-induced lipid abnormalities appear to be mediated via PTGS1 and its downstream product 15d-PGJ2 and suggest a novel therapeutic target to prevent some of the adverse effects of fluoxetine treatment. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Taken together these results suggest that fluoxetine-induced lipid abnormalities appear to be mediated via PTGS1 and its downstream product 15d-PGJ2 and suggest a novel therapeutic target to prevent some of the adverse effects of fluoxetine treatment. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Holloway AC(1). Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders are often managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. Fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant, is widely used as a first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, fluoxetine has also been shown to increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fluoxetine has been shown to increase hepatic lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro. In addition, fluoxetine has been shown to alter the production of prostaglandins which have also been implicated in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of fluoxetine exposure on the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway and lipid accumulation in a hepatic cell line (H4-II-E-C3 cells). Fluoxetine treatment increased mRNA expression of prostaglandin biosynthetic enzymes (Ptgs1, Ptgs2, and Ptgds), PPAR gamma (Pparg), and PPAR gamma downstream targets involved in fatty acid uptake (Cd36, Fatp2, and Fatp5) as well as production of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 a PPAR gamma ligand. The effects of fluoxetine to induce lipid accumulation were attenuated with a PTGS1 specific inhibitor (SC-560), whereas inhibition of PTGS2 had no effect. Moreover, SC-560 attenuated 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2 production and expression of PPAR gamma downstream target genes.

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from hepatic steatosis [excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG)] to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular pathogenesis of steatosis and progression to more severe NAFLD remains unclear. Obesity and aging, two principal risk factors for NAFLD, are associated with a hyperadrenergic state. β-Adrenergic responsiveness in liver increases in animal models of obesity and aging, and in both is linked to increased hepatic expression of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs). We previously showed that in aging rodents intracellular signaling from elevated hepatic levels of β2-ARs may contribute to liver steatosis. In this study we demonstrate that injection of formoterol, a highly selective β2-AR agonist, to mice acutely results in hepatic TG accumulation. Further, we have sought to define the intrahepatic mechanisms underlying β2-AR mediated steatosis by investigating changes in hepatic expression and cellular localization of enzymes, transcription factors, and coactivators involved in processes of lipid accrual and disposition-and also functional aspects thereof-in livers of formoterol-treated animals. Our results suggest that β2-AR activation by formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, increased but incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of potentially toxic long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion-all previously invoked as contributors to fatty liver disease. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether sustained activation of hepatic β2-AR signaling by formoterol might be utilized to model fatty liver changes occurring in hyperadrenergic states of obesity and aging, and thereby identify novel molecular targets for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Results of our study suggest that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) activation by agonist formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from hepatic steatosis [excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG)] to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular pathogenesis of steatosis and progression to more severe NAFLD remains unclear. Obesity and aging, two principal risk factors for NAFLD, are associated with a hyperadrenergic state. β-Adrenergic responsiveness in liver increases in animal models of obesity and aging, and in both is linked to increased hepatic expression of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs). We previously showed that in aging rodents intracellular signaling from elevated hepatic levels of β2-ARs may contribute to liver steatosis. In this study we demonstrate that injection of formoterol, a highly selective β2-AR agonist, to mice acutely results in hepatic TG accumulation. Further, we have sought to define the intrahepatic mechanisms underlying β2-AR mediated steatosis by investigating changes in hepatic expression and cellular localization of enzymes, transcription factors, and coactivators involved in processes of lipid accrual and disposition-and also functional aspects thereof-in livers of formoterol-treated animals. Our results suggest that β2-AR activation by formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, increased but incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of potentially toxic long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion-all previously invoked as contributors to fatty liver disease. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether sustained activation of hepatic β2-AR signaling by formoterol might be utilized to model fatty liver changes occurring in hyperadrenergic states of obesity and aging, and thereby identify novel molecular targets for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Results of our study suggest that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) activation by agonist formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion.

OBJECTIVES: The incidence of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) induced by high fructose consumption is dramatically increasing in the world while lacking specifically therapeutic drugs. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of complement C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) on fructose-induced MAFLD and its potential mechanisms. METHOD: The animal models with MAFLD were built with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats drinking 10 % fructose solution for 12 weeks. Then, specific hepatic CTRP3 overexpression was conducted by a single caudal-vein injection of CTRP3-expressing adenoviruses. Rats were sacrificed two weeks later. RESULTS: Drinking 10 % fructose solution for 12 weeks successfully built the rats models with MAFLD. Fructose feeding markedly decreased hepatic CTRP3 expression in rats. However, CTRP3 overexpression in liver alleviated hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, liver function injury, intrahepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation and histological changes of hepatic steatosis in rats fed with fructose. CTRP3 overexpression also inhibited hepatic XO activity in liver and improved subsequent oxidative stress, accompanied with downregulation of gene expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein 1c (SERBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). CONCLUSION: CTRP3 attenuates MAFLD induced by fructose, which maybe partially attribute to rescued oxidative stress related with xanthine oxidase overactivity.",

BACKGROUND & AIM: Fructose diets have been shown to induce insulin resistance and to alter liver metabolism and gut barrier function, ultimately leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Citrulline, Glutamine and Arginine may improve insulin sensitivity and have beneficial effects on gut trophicity. Our aim was to evaluate their effects on liver and gut functions in a rat model of fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 58) received a 4-week fructose (60%) diet or standard chow with or without Citrulline (0.15 g/d) or an isomolar amount of Arginine or Glutamine. All diets were made isonitrogenous by addition of non-essential amino acids. At week 4, nutritional and metabolic status (plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and amino acids, net intestinal absorption) was determined; steatosis (hepatic triglycerides content, histological examination) and hepatic function (plasma aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) were assessed; and gut barrier integrity (myeloperoxidase activity, portal endotoxemia, tight junction protein expression and localization) and intestinal and hepatic inflammation were evaluated. We also assessed diets effects on caecal microbiota. RESULTS: In these experimental isonitrogenous fructose diet conditions, fructose led to steatosis with dyslipidemia but without altering glucose homeostasis, liver function or gut permeability. Fructose significantly decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and tended to increase endotoxemia. Arginine and Glutamine supplements were ineffective but Citrulline supplementation prevented hypertriglyceridemia and attenuated liver fat accumulation. CONCLUSION: While nitrogen supply alone can attenuate fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Citrulline appears to act directly on hepatic lipid metabolism by partially preventing hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Fructose diets have been shown to induce insulin resistance and to alter liver metabolism and gut barrier function, ultimately leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Citrulline, Glutamine and Arginine may improve insulin sensitivity and have beneficial effects on gut trophicity. Our aim was to evaluate their effects on liver and gut functions in a rat model of fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 58) received a 4-week fructose (60%) diet or standard chow with or without Citrulline (0.15 g/d) or an isomolar amount of Arginine or Glutamine. All diets were made isonitrogenous by addition of non-essential amino acids. At week 4, nutritional and metabolic status (plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and amino acids, net intestinal absorption) was determined; steatosis (hepatic triglycerides content, histological examination) and hepatic function (plasma aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) were assessed; and gut barrier integrity (myeloperoxidase activity, portal endotoxemia, tight junction protein expression and localization) and intestinal and hepatic inflammation were evaluated. We also assessed diets effects on caecal microbiota. RESULTS: In these experimental isonitrogenous fructose diet conditions, fructose led to steatosis with dyslipidemia but without altering glucose homeostasis, liver function or gut permeability. Fructose significantly decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and tended to increase endotoxemia. Arginine and Glutamine supplements were ineffective but Citrulline supplementation prevented hypertriglyceridemia and attenuated liver fat accumulation. CONCLUSION: While nitrogen supply alone can attenuate fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Citrulline appears to act directly on hepatic lipid metabolism by partially preventing hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis.

High-fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) has been suggested to be more lipogenic than sucrose, which increases the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and dyslipidemia. The study objectives were to determine the effects of drinking different sugar-sweetened solutions on hepatic gene expression in relation to liver fatty acid composition and risk of NAFLD. Female rats were randomly assigned (n=7 rats/group) to drink water or water sweetened with 13% (w/v) HFCS-55, sucrose or fructose for 8 weeks. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest (P=.03) hepatic total lipid and triglyceride content and histological evidence of fat infiltration. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest hepatic de novo lipogenesis indicated by the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and the highest (P<.001) oleic acid (18:1n-9) content. This was accompanied by reduced β-oxidation indicated by down-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Disposal of excess lipids by export of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein from the liver was increased as shown by up-regulation of gene expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in rats drinking sucrose, but not HFCS-55 solution. The observed lipogenic effects were attributed to the slightly higher fructose content of HFCS-55 solution in the absence of differences in macronutrient and total caloric intake between rats drinking HFCS-55 and sucrose solution. Results from gene expression and fatty acid composition analysis showed that, in a hypercaloric state, some types of sugars are more detrimental to the liver. Based on these preclinical study results, excess consumption of caloric sweetened beverage, particularly HFCS-sweetened beverages, should be limited. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vitamin A and its metabolites are known to regulate lipid metabolism. However so far, no study has assessed, whether vitamin A deficiency per se aggravates or attenuates the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, here, we tested the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the development of NAFLD. METHODS: Male weanling Wistar rats were fed one of the following diets; control, vitamin A-deficient (VAD), high fructose (HFr) and VAD with HFr (VADHFr) of AIN93G composition, for 16weeks, except half of the VAD diet-fed rats were shifted to HFr diet (VAD(s)HFr), at the end of 8(th) week. RESULTS: Animals fed on VAD diet with HFr displayed hypotriglyceridemia (33.5mg/dL) with attenuated hepatic triglyceride accumulation (8.2mg/g), compared with HFr diet (89.5mg/dL and 20.6mg/g respectively). These changes could be partly explained by the decreased activity of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and the down-regulation of stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), both at gene and protein levels, the key determinants of triglyceride biosynthesis. On the other hand, n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid and its active metabolite; resolvin D1 (RvD1) levels were elevated in the liver and plasma of VAD diet-fed groups, which was negatively associated with triglyceride levels. All these factors confer vitamin A deficiency-mediated protection against the development of hepatic steatosis, which was also evident from the group shifted from VAD to HFr diet. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin A deficiency attenuates high fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, by regulating triglyceride synthesis, possibly through GPDH, SCD1 and RvD1.",

After 7 weeks, in vivo hepatic dietary lipid uptake and de novo lipogenesis were assessed with proton-observed, carbon-13-edited MRS combined with 13C-labeled lipids and 13C-labeled glucose, respectively. The molecular basis of alterations in hepatic liver metabolism was analyzed in detail ex vivo using immunoblotting and targeted quantitative proteomics. Both glucose and fructose feeding increased adiposity, but only fructose induced hepatic lipid accumulation. In vivo MRS showed that this was not caused by increased hepatic uptake of dietary lipids, but could be attributed to an increase in de novo lipogenesis. Stimulation of lipogenesis by fructose was confirmed by a strong upregulation of lipogenic enzymes, which was more potent than with glucose. The non-caloric sweetener aspartame did not significantly affect liver lipid content or metabolism. In conclusion, liquid fructose more severely affected liver lipid metabolism in rats than glucose, while aspartame had no effect.

We aimed to elucidate the effects of caloric and non-caloric sweeteners on liver lipid metabolism in rats using in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to determine their roles in the development of liver steatosis. Wistar rats received normal chow and either normal drinking water, or solutions containing 13% (w/v) glucose, 13% fructose, or 0.4% aspartame. After 7 weeks, in vivo hepatic dietary lipid uptake and de novo lipogenesis were assessed with proton-observed, carbon-13-edited MRS combined with 13C-labeled lipids and 13C-labeled glucose, respectively. The molecular basis of alterations in hepatic liver metabolism was analyzed in detail ex vivo using immunoblotting and targeted quantitative proteomics. Both glucose and fructose feeding increased adiposity, but only fructose induced hepatic lipid accumulation. In vivo MRS showed that this was not caused by increased hepatic uptake of dietary lipids, but could be attributed to an increase in de novo lipogenesis. Stimulation of lipogenesis by fructose was confirmed by a strong upregulation of lipogenic enzymes, which was more potent than with glucose. The non-caloric sweetener aspartame did not significantly affect liver lipid content or metabolism. In conclusion, liquid fructose more severely affected liver lipid metabolism in rats than glucose, while aspartame had no effect.

Residues of glyphosate (GLY) are widely detected in aquatic systems, raising potential environmental threats and public health concerns, but the mechanism underlying GLY-induced hepatotoxicity in fish has not been fully elucidated yet. This study was designed to explore the hepatotoxic mechanism using juvenile common carp exposed to GLY for 45 d, and plasma and liver samples were collected at 15 d, 30 d, and 45 d to analyze the assays. First, GLY-induced hepatic damage was confirmed by serum liver damage biomarker and hepatic histopathological analysis. Next, changes in oxidative stress biomarkers, gene expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and lipid metabolism-related parameters in collected samples were analyzed to clarify their roles in GLY-induced hepatic damage. Data showed that oxidative stress was an early event during GLY exposure, followed by hepatic inflammatory response. Lipid metabolism disorder was a late event during GLY exposure, as evidenced by overproduced hepatic free fatty acids, enhanced lipogenesis-related gene expression levels, reduced lipolysis-related gene expression levels, and resultant hepatic lipid accumulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GLY induces hepatotoxicity in fish through involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and lipid metabolism disorder, which are intimately interrelated with each other during GLY exposure.

High-fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) has been suggested to be more lipogenic than sucrose, which increases the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and dyslipidemia. The study objectives were to determine the effects of drinking different sugar-sweetened solutions on hepatic gene expression in relation to liver fatty acid composition and risk of NAFLD. Female rats were randomly assigned (n=7 rats/group) to drink water or water sweetened with 13% (w/v) HFCS-55, sucrose or fructose for 8 weeks. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest (P=.03) hepatic total lipid and triglyceride content and histological evidence of fat infiltration. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest hepatic de novo lipogenesis indicated by the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and the highest (P<.001) oleic acid (18:1n-9) content. This was accompanied by reduced β-oxidation indicated by down-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Disposal of excess lipids by export of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein from the liver was increased as shown by up-regulation of gene expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in rats drinking sucrose, but not HFCS-55 solution. The observed lipogenic effects were attributed to the slightly higher fructose content of HFCS-55 solution in the absence of differences in macronutrient and total caloric intake between rats drinking HFCS-55 and sucrose solution. Results from gene expression and fatty acid composition analysis showed that, in a hypercaloric state, some types of sugars are more detrimental to the liver. Based on these preclinical study results, excess consumption of caloric sweetened beverage, particularly HFCS-sweetened beverages, should be limited. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Elevated circulating homocysteine (Hcy) has been proposed to be associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is also reported that Hcy causes protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we used a high methionine diet (HMD)-fed mouse model and cultured primary hepatocytes to investigate the effects of Hcy on hepatic lipids metabolism. C57BL/6J mice received either standard chow diet (CT, n = 10) or diet supplemented with 2% methionine (MET, n = 10) for 16 weeks. In in vitro experiments, cultured mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with Hcy, or Hcy combined with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), or tunicamycin (TM), respectively. HMD-fed mice exhibited a mild increase in plasma Hcy level. There was no significant difference of body weight gain between the two groups. Nevertheless, HMD feeding increased epididymal fat/body weight ratio, elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) level, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) level. Similarly, mice on HMD displayed higher liver/body weight ratio, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and its ratio to alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was supported by the morphological observations of hepatic triglyceride accumulation in liver tissue as well as primary hepatocytes. Activation of the sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) in Hcy-treated hepatocytes with increased expression of genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis was partially reduced by pretreatment of 4-PBA. Hcy-induced ER stress was also ameliorated by 4-PBA pretreatment, thus demonstrating an important role of Hcy-induced ER stress response in hepatic steatosis. These findings suggest that elevated Hcy was a critical factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Activation of the ER stress response may be involved in Hcy-induced hepatic steatosis.

Dong YQ(1), Zhang XZ(1), Sun LL(1), Zhang SY(1), Liu HY(1), Jiang CT(1). Author information: (1)Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Science, Ministry of Education and Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Receptors Research, Beijing 100191, China. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a key risk factor in hepatic steatosis. In this study, we applied a metabolomic approach to investigate the changes in the metabolite profile due to HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis and the effects of omega-3 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) supplementation in mice. HHcy was induced in mice by giving DL-Hcy (1.8 g/L) in drinking water for 6 weeks, then the mice were sacrificed, and the metabolic profiles of the liver and plasma were analyzed through UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS-based lipidomics. Hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol were further assayed. The expression of ceramide metabolism-related genes was measured by quantitative PCR. Compared with control mice, HHcy mice exhibited hepatic steatosis with a notable increase in ceramide-related metabolites and subsequent upregulation of ceramide synthesis genes such as Sptlc3, Degs2, Cer4 and Smpd4. Omega-3 PUFA was simultaneously administered in HHcy mice through chow diet containing 3.3% omega-3 PUFA supplement for 6 weeks, which significantly ameliorated Hcy-induced hepatic steatosis. The decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation was mainly due to reduced hepatic levels of ceramides, which was partly the result of the lower expression of ceramide synthesis genes, Sptlc3 and Degs2. Similar beneficial effects of DHA were observed in Hcy-stimulated primary hepatocytes in vitro. In summary, Hcy-induced ceramide elevation in hepatocytes might contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, downregulation of ceramide levels through omega-3 PUFA supplementation ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation. Thus, ceramide is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5719150",

Compared with control mice, HHcy mice exhibited hepatic steatosis with a notable increase in ceramide-related metabolites and subsequent upregulation of ceramide synthesis genes such as Sptlc3, Degs2, Cer4 and Smpd4. Omega-3 PUFA was simultaneously administered in HHcy mice through chow diet containing 3.3% omega-3 PUFA supplement for 6 weeks, which significantly ameliorated Hcy-induced hepatic steatosis. The decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation was mainly due to reduced hepatic levels of ceramides, which was partly the result of the lower expression of ceramide synthesis genes, Sptlc3 and Degs2. Similar beneficial effects of DHA were observed in Hcy-stimulated primary hepatocytes in vitro. In summary, Hcy-induced ceramide elevation in hepatocytes might contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, downregulation of ceramide levels through omega-3 PUFA supplementation ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation. Thus, ceramide is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5719150",

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the world's most common liver disease. The disease can develop liver fibrosis or even carcinomas from the initial hepatic steatosis, and this process is influenced by many factors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), as potent oxidants in cells, have been reported previously to play an important role in the development of NAFLD progression via promoting neutral lipid accumulation. Here, we found that ROS can promote lipid droplet formation in hepatocytes by promoting perilipin2 (PLIN2) expression. First, we used different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to treat HepG2 cells and found that the number of lipid droplets in the cells increased, however also that this effect was dose-independent. Then, the mRNA level of several lipid droplet-associated genes was detected with hydrogen peroxide treatment and the expression of PLIN2, PLIN5, and FSP27 genes was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05). We overexpressed PLIN2 in HepG2 cells and found that the lipid droplets in the cells were markedly increased. Interference with PLIN2 inhibits ROS-induced lipid droplet formation, revealing that PLIN2 is a critical factor in this process. We subsequently analyzed the regulatory pathway and protein interaction network that is involved in PLIN2 and found that PLIN2 can regulate intracellular lipid metabolism through the PPARα/RXRA and CREB/CREBBP signaling pathways. The majority of the data indicated the correlation between hydrogen peroxide-induced PLIN2 and lipid droplet upregulation. In conclusion, ROS up-regulates the expression of PLIN2 in hepatocytes, whereas PLIN2 promotes the formation of lipid droplets resulting in lipid accumulation in liver tissues.

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

Ambient particulate matter (PM) newly has been regarded as a conceivable hazard for public health. A large number of studies have described that PM, exceptionally PM2.5, is correlated with respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases, etc. PM2.5-induced hepatocyte steatosis previously has been uncovered both in cellular and murine models. Nevertheless, less is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we found that PM2.5 could cause the downregulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a key transcription factor for lipid metabolism. FXR could regulate the accumulation of lipid droplets induced by PM2.5 in vitro. Moreover, FXR-/- mice were exposed to PM2.5 for 2 months to investigate the role of FXR in pathogenesis of PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo. The results showed that exposure of wild-type (WT) mice to PM2.5 caused mild liver steatosis compared with the mice exposure to filtered air (FA). Furthermore, the content of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) was elevated in WT mice liver triggered by the inhalation of PM2.5. However, there was no statistical difference in TG and TC content between FXR-/- mice with and without PM2.5 exposure. Overall, our finding suggested FXR mediated PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis.",

FXR could regulate the accumulation of lipid droplets induced by PM2.5 in vitro. Moreover, FXR-/- mice were exposed to PM2.5 for 2 months to investigate the role of FXR in pathogenesis of PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo. The results showed that exposure of wild-type (WT) mice to PM2.5 caused mild liver steatosis compared with the mice exposure to filtered air (FA). Furthermore, the content of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) was elevated in WT mice liver triggered by the inhalation of PM2.5. However, there was no statistical difference in TG and TC content between FXR-/- mice with and without PM2.5 exposure. Overall, our finding suggested FXR mediated PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis.",

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Iron overload (IO) is a frequent finding in the general population. As the major iron storage site, the liver is subject to iron toxicity. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid metabolism and is implicated in various liver diseases. We aimed to determine whether FXR plays a role in regulating iron hepatotoxicity. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Human and mouse hepatocytes were treated with ferric ammonium citrate or iron dextran (FeDx). Mice were orally administered ferrous sulfate or injected i.p. with FeDx. Wild-type and Fxr-/- mice were fed an iron-rich diet for 1 or 5 weeks. Mice fed an iron-rich diet were coadministered the FXR agonist, GW4064. Forced expression of FXR was carried out with recombinant adeno-associated virus 1 week before iron-rich diet feeding. Serum levels of bile acids and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) were quantified in adults with hyperferritinemia and children with β-thalassemia. The data demonstrated that iron suppressed FXR expression and signaling in human and mouse hepatocytes as well as in mouse liver and intestine. FXR deficiency potentiated iron hepatotoxicity, accompanied with hepatic steatosis as well as dysregulated iron and bile acid homeostasis. FXR negatively regulated iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 and prevented hepatic iron accumulation. Forced FXR expression and ligand activation significantly suppressed iron hepatotoxicity in iron-fed mice. The FXR agonist, GW4064, almost completely restored dysregulated bile acid signaling and metabolic syndrome in iron-fed mice. Conjugated primary bile acids were increased and FGF19 was decreased in serum of adults with hyperferritinemia and children with β-thalassemia. CONCLUSIONS: FXR plays a pivotal role in regulating iron homeostasis and protects mice against iron hepatotoxicity. Targeting FXR may represent a therapeutic strategy for IO-associated chronic liver diseases. © 2021 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",

Author information: (1)Center for Translational Biomedical Research, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina. (2)Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina. BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling has been shown to regulate lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Previous studies have shown that hepatic PPARγ is up-regulated in steatotic liver of both animal and human. However, the effects of hepatic PPARγ signaling on alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remain elusive. METHODS: To determine the role of hepatic PPARγ signaling on ALD, wild-type (WT) and hepatocyte-specific PPARγ knockdown (PPARγ∆Hep) mice were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin control liquid diet for 8 weeks to induce ALD. Blood parameters, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation were measured after 8-week alcohol feeding. RESULTS: Alcohol feeding to WT mice resulted in liver damage (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], 94.68 ± 17.05 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 55.87 ± 11.29 U/L), which was significantly alleviated by hepatic PPARγ knockdown (ALT, 57.36 ± 14.98 U/L; AST, 38.06 ± 3.35 U/L). Alcohol feeding led to marked lipid accumulation and up-regulation of lipogenic genes including fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), lipin1 (LIPIN1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) in the livers of WT mice. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ significantly alleviated alcohol-induced lipid accumulation and abolished the up-regulation of FASN, DGAT1, and DGAT2. Silencing of PPARγ in FL83B cells significantly decreased ethanol (EtOH)-, linoleic acid-, and EtOH plus linoleic acid-induced lipid accumulation. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ also significantly reduced alcohol-induced inflammatory chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP1], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]) and inflammatory infiltration (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G], and F4/80). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that hepatic PPARγ signaling contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury by promoting hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

DPP-4 inhibitors might be protective against fatty liver. We previously reported that the systemic inhibition of insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) by the administration of OSI-906 (linsitinib), a dual IR/IGF1R inhibitor, induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipoatrophy in mice. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, on hepatic steatosis in OSI-906-treated mice. Unlike high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis is not characterized by elevations in inflammatory responses or oxidative stress levels. Linagliptin improved OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis via an insulin-signaling-independent pathway, without altering glucose levels, free fatty acid levels, gluconeogenic gene expressions in the liver, or visceral fat atrophy. Hepatic quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that perilipin-2 (PLIN2), major urinary protein 20 (MUP20), cytochrome P450 2b10 (CYP2B10), and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) are possibly involved in the process of the amelioration of hepatic steatosis by linagliptin. Thus, linagliptin improved hepatic steatosis induced by IR and IGF1R inhibition via a previously unknown mechanism that did not involve gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, or inflammation, suggesting the non-canonical actions of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of hepatic steatosis under insulin-resistant conditions.

In this work, we investigated the effect of the combination of lomitapide and triiodothyronine (T3) in Zucker fatty rats. Lomitapide (1 mg/kg, PO), or T3 (13 μg/kg, PO), or their combination, were given to these rats once daily for fourteen days. Body weight and food intake were recorded once daily during the treatment period. Serum and hepatic lipids, glucose tolerance, serum aminotransferases, bile fluids, hepatic gene expression, and liver histology were assessed at the end of the treatment. Lomitapide treatment reduced body weight, food intake, glucose intolerance, and serum lipids, and elevated serum aminotransferases and liver lipids. When combined with T3, lomitapide showed an enhanced reduction in body weight, food intake, serum cholesterol, serum LDL, and glucose intolerance. The combination treatment increased bile flow rate and biliary cholesterol excretion rate. Combining T3 with lomitapide attenuated the elevation of serum aminotransferases and liver lipids. Hepatic ABCB11, ABCG5, ABCG8, CYP7A1, CPT1, and ACOX1 expressions were increased with combination treatment. Histological analysis indicated that T3 attenuated hepatic fat accumulation caused by lomitapide. These data suggests that combining lomitapide with T3 may reduce lomitapide-induced hepatic toxicity and provide additional benefits in obesity and glucose intolerance.",

However, it has been found to have deleterious effects on human health and on the environment. Indeed, its massive use has raised the issue of possible health risks for agrarian communities; the molecule can also reach human cells via the food chain and alter metabolism, endocrine activity and cell survival. In particular, mancozeb induces many toxic effects on hepatic cell metabolism. For this reason, we investigated its effect in an in vitro model of hepatic damage, namely fatty acid-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the HepG2 cell line. We found that the hepatic toxicity of the fungicide exacerbated fatty acid-induced steatosis, as manifested by an increase in intracellular lipid droplet accumulation. Furthermore, mancozeb altered cell metabolism and induced cell death through upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c, respectively, in dose-dependent manners. Therefore, mancozeb may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic disease in humans and represents a danger for human health in high doses.",

Elevated circulating homocysteine (Hcy) has been proposed to be associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is also reported that Hcy causes protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we used a high methionine diet (HMD)-fed mouse model and cultured primary hepatocytes to investigate the effects of Hcy on hepatic lipids metabolism. C57BL/6J mice received either standard chow diet (CT, n = 10) or diet supplemented with 2% methionine (MET, n = 10) for 16 weeks. In in vitro experiments, cultured mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with Hcy, or Hcy combined with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), or tunicamycin (TM), respectively. HMD-fed mice exhibited a mild increase in plasma Hcy level. There was no significant difference of body weight gain between the two groups. Nevertheless, HMD feeding increased epididymal fat/body weight ratio, elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) level, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) level. Similarly, mice on HMD displayed higher liver/body weight ratio, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and its ratio to alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was supported by the morphological observations of hepatic triglyceride accumulation in liver tissue as well as primary hepatocytes. Activation of the sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) in Hcy-treated hepatocytes with increased expression of genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis was partially reduced by pretreatment of 4-PBA. Hcy-induced ER stress was also ameliorated by 4-PBA pretreatment, thus demonstrating an important role of Hcy-induced ER stress response in hepatic steatosis. These findings suggest that elevated Hcy was a critical factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Activation of the ER stress response may be involved in Hcy-induced hepatic steatosis.

(3)Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology, Basel, Switzerland. Impairment of hepatic fatty acid metabolism can lead to liver steatosis and injury. Testing drugs for interference with hepatic fatty acid metabolism is therefore important. To find out whether HepG2 cells are suitable for this purpose, we investigated the effect of three established fatty acid metabolism inhibitors and of three test compounds on triglyceride accumulation, palmitate metabolism, the acylcarnitine pool and dicarboxylic acid accumulation in the cell supernatant and on ApoB-100 excretion in HepG2 cells. The three established inhibitors [etomoxir, methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA)] depleted mitochondrial ATP at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. They inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or lower concentrations than ATP depletion, and 4-BCA was associated with cellular fat accumulation. They caused specific changes in the acylcarnitine pattern and etomoxir an increase of thapsic (C18 dicarboxylic) acid in the cell supernatant, and did not interfere with ApoB-100 excretion (marker of VLDL export). The three test compounds (amiodarone, tamoxifen, and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2) depleted the cellular ATP content at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred. They all caused cellular fat accumulation and inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or higher concentrations than ATP depletion. They suppressed medium-chain acylcarnitines in the cell supernatant and amiodarone and tamoxifen impaired thapsic acid production. Tamoxifen and WIN 55,212-2 decreased cellular ApoB-100 excretion. In conclusion, the established inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism caused the expected effects in HepG2 cells. HepG cells proved to be useful for the detection of drug-associated toxicities on hepatocellular fatty acid metabolism. PMCID: PMC5924803",

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a hepatic disorder with deposition of fat droplets and has a high risk of progression to steatosis-related hepatitis and irreversible hepatic cancer. Metronidazole (MNZ) is an antiprotozoal and antimicrobial agent widely used to treat patients infected with anaerobic bacteria and intestinal parasites; however, MNZ has also been shown to induce liver tumors in rodents. To investigate the effects of MNZ on steatosis-related early-stage hepatocarcinogenesis, male rats treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine following 2/3 hepatectomy at week 3 were received a control basal diet, high fat diet (HFD), or HFD containing 0.5% MNZ. The HFD induced obesity and steatosis in the liver, accompanied by altered expression of Pparg and Fasn, genes related to lipid metabolism. MNZ increased nuclear translocation of lipid metabolism-related transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in hepatocytes, together with altered liver expression of lipid metabolism genes (Srebf1, Srebf2, Pnpla2). Furthermore, MNZ significantly increased the number of preneoplastic liver foci, accompanied by DNA double-strand breaks and late-stage autophagy inhibition, as reflected by increased levels of γ-H2AX, LC3, and p62. Therefore, MNZ could induce steatosis-related hepatocarcinogenesis by inducing DNA double-strand breaks and modulating autophagy in HFD-fed rats. © 2021.

The present report tests the hypothesis that early life exposure to microcystin (MC), a principal component of harmful algal blooms followed by a juvenile exposure to high-fat diet feeding potentiate the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease phenotype in adulthood. Results showed classical symptoms of early NAFLD linked inflammation. Cytokines and chemokines such as CD68, IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α, as well as α-SMA were increased in the groups that were exposed to MC-LR with the high-fat diet compared to the vehicle group. Also, mechanistically, NLRP3 KO mice showed a significant decrease in the inflammation and NAFLD phenotype and resisted the metabolic changes such as insulin resistance and glucose metabolism in the liver. The data suggested that MC-LR exposure and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation in childhood could impact liver health in juveniles.

Energy metabolism plays important roles in stress resistance and immunity in mammals, however, such functions have not been established in fish. In the present study, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was fed with mildronate, an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation, for six weeks subsequently challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and ammonia nitrogen exposure. Mildronate treatment reduced significantly l-carnitine concentration and mitochondrial FA β-oxidation efficiency, while it increased lipid accumulation in liver. The fish with inhibited hepatic FA catabolism had lower survival rate when exposed to Aeromonas hydrophila and ammonia nitrogen. Moreover, fish fed mildronate supplemented diet had lower immune enzymes activities and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes expressions, but had higher pro-inflammatory cytokine genes expressions. However, the oxidative stress-related biochemical indexes were not significantly affected by mildronate treatment. Taken together, inhibited mitochondrial FA β-oxidation impaired stress resistance ability in Nile tilapia mainly through inhibiting immune functions and triggering inflammation. This is the first study showing the regulatory effects of lipid catabolism on stress resistance and immune functions in fish.",

Electronic address: gsong@umn.edu. BACKGROUNDS: The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing due to the prevalence of obesity. NAFLD is a major risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Even with successful surgical removal, the presence of NAFLD is associated with an increased recurrence of HCC. Despite the extensive study of NAFLD, its underlying mechanism(s) remains essentially unknown and there are no FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Alterations in microRNA (miR) expression have been observed in human fatty livers. However, regulatory mechanism(s) of miRNA biogenesis and their role in regulating the development of NAFLD is poorly described. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry, luciferase assays and immunoblotting to study the regulatory mechanism of miR-378 biogenesis. Wild-type mice kept on a high fat diet (HFD) were injected with miR-378 inhibitors or a mini-circle expression system containing miR-378 to study loss and gain-of functions of miR-378. RESULTS: miR-378 was significantly increased in fatty livers of dietary obese mice and human hepatoma HepG2 cells with accumulated lipid. Further studies identified NRF1 (Nuclear receptor factor 1), a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as a direct target of miR-378. Overexpression of miR-378 impaired FAO and promoted lipid accumulation in murine hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-378 using its ASO (anti-sense oligo) improved FAO and reduced intracellular lipid content in Hepa1-6 cells. Liver-specific expression of miR-378 impaired FAO, which subsequently promoted the development of hepatosteatosis. Antagonizing miR-378 via injecting miR-378-ASO into HFD-treated mice led to increased expression of Nrf1, improved FAO and decreased hepatosteatosis. Additional knockdown of up-regulated Nrf1 offset the effects of miR-378-ASO, suggesting that Nrf1 mediated the inhibitory effect of miR-378-ASO on hepatosteatosis. Furthermore, Nrf1 was identified as a transcriptional repressor of miR-378. Ablation of Nrf1 using its shRNA in livers led to increased miR-378, which subsequently resulted in reduced FAO and elevated hepatic lipid content. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identified a negative feedback loop between miR-378 and Nrf1 that promotes the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis, and suggests the use of miR-378 as a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.

Electronic address: gsong@umn.edu. BACKGROUNDS: The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing due to the prevalence of obesity. NAFLD is a major risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Even with successful surgical removal, the presence of NAFLD is associated with an increased recurrence of HCC. Despite the extensive study of NAFLD, its underlying mechanism(s) remains essentially unknown and there are no FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Alterations in microRNA (miR) expression have been observed in human fatty livers. However, regulatory mechanism(s) of miRNA biogenesis and their role in regulating the development of NAFLD is poorly described. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry, luciferase assays and immunoblotting to study the regulatory mechanism of miR-378 biogenesis. Wild-type mice kept on a high fat diet (HFD) were injected with miR-378 inhibitors or a mini-circle expression system containing miR-378 to study loss and gain-of functions of miR-378. RESULTS: miR-378 was significantly increased in fatty livers of dietary obese mice and human hepatoma HepG2 cells with accumulated lipid. Further studies identified NRF1 (Nuclear receptor factor 1), a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as a direct target of miR-378. Overexpression of miR-378 impaired FAO and promoted lipid accumulation in murine hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-378 using its ASO (anti-sense oligo) improved FAO and reduced intracellular lipid content in Hepa1-6 cells. Liver-specific expression of miR-378 impaired FAO, which subsequently promoted the development of hepatosteatosis. Antagonizing miR-378 via injecting miR-378-ASO into HFD-treated mice led to increased expression of Nrf1, improved FAO and decreased hepatosteatosis. Additional knockdown of up-regulated Nrf1 offset the effects of miR-378-ASO, suggesting that Nrf1 mediated the inhibitory effect of miR-378-ASO on hepatosteatosis. Furthermore, Nrf1 was identified as a transcriptional repressor of miR-378. Ablation of Nrf1 using its shRNA in livers led to increased miR-378, which subsequently resulted in reduced FAO and elevated hepatic lipid content. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identified a negative feedback loop between miR-378 and Nrf1 that promotes the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis, and suggests the use of miR-378 as a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.

Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), as the major metabolite of Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), can induce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and further leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while the underlying mechanism is unclear. We aim to clarify the effects of JAK2/STAT5 pathway on lipid accumulation induced by MEHP and the role of oxidation stress in NAFLD. BRL-3A hepatocytes were exposed to MEHP (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM) for 24 h and 48 h. Then the lipid droplets in cells were observed by Oil-Red-O staining and quantified by isopropyl alcohol. The levels of TG, SOD, TBARS, AST and ALT were all detected by commercial kits. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression, and western blotting was used to detect the expression of proteins encoded by JAK2/STAT5 pathway genes and lipid metabolism-related genes. As a result, MEHP promoted the lipid synthesis and accumulation in BRL-3A cells. MEHP down-regulated the expression and inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT5. Moreover, the lipid metabolism-related kinases levels were elevated after MEHP exposure. In addition, the SOD levels were gradually decreased and the TBARS levels were increased in MEHP-treated groups. The lipid metabolism-related proteins levels were correlated with the oxidation stress levels. Furthermore, the ALT and AST levels were elevated after MEHP exposure. Therefore, we concluded that MEHP led to lipid accumulation through inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 pathway, resulted in damaging liver parenchyma and NAFLD by aggravating oxidation stress.",

Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), as the major metabolite of Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), can induce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and further leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while the underlying mechanism is unclear. We aim to clarify the effects of JAK2/STAT5 pathway on lipid accumulation induced by MEHP and the role of oxidation stress in NAFLD. BRL-3A hepatocytes were exposed to MEHP (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM) for 24 h and 48 h. Then the lipid droplets in cells were observed by Oil-Red-O staining and quantified by isopropyl alcohol. The levels of TG, SOD, TBARS, AST and ALT were all detected by commercial kits. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression, and western blotting was used to detect the expression of proteins encoded by JAK2/STAT5 pathway genes and lipid metabolism-related genes. As a result, MEHP promoted the lipid synthesis and accumulation in BRL-3A cells. MEHP down-regulated the expression and inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT5. Moreover, the lipid metabolism-related kinases levels were elevated after MEHP exposure. In addition, the SOD levels were gradually decreased and the TBARS levels were increased in MEHP-treated groups. The lipid metabolism-related proteins levels were correlated with the oxidation stress levels. Furthermore, the ALT and AST levels were elevated after MEHP exposure. Therefore, we concluded that MEHP led to lipid accumulation through inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 pathway, resulted in damaging liver parenchyma and NAFLD by aggravating oxidation stress.",

MEHP exposure has been linked to abnormal development, increased oxidative stress, and metabolic syndrome in vertebrates. Nuclear factor, Erythroid 2 Like 2 (Nrf2), is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in response to oxidative stress. We investigated the role of Nrf2a in larval steatosis following embryonic exposure to MEHP. Wild-type and nrf2a mutant (m) zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0 or 200 μg/l MEHP from 6 to either 96 (histology) or 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). At 120 hpf, exposures were ceased and fish were maintained in clean conditions until 15 days post fertilization (dpf). At 15 dpf, fish lengths and lipid content were examined, and the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant response and lipid processing was quantified. At 96 hpf, a subset of animals treated with MEHP had vacuolization in the liver. At 15 dpf, deficient Nrf2a signaling attenuated fish length by 7.7%. MEHP exposure increased hepatic steatosis and increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha target fabp1a1. Cumulatively, these data indicate that developmental exposure alone to MEHP may increase risk for hepatic steatosis and that Nrf2a does not play a major role in this phenotype. PMCID: PMC7429360",

In our previous study, we demonstrated the potential of monocrotophos (MCP), an organophosphorus insecticide (OPI), to induce glucose intolerance, insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia with hyperinsulinemia in rats after chronic exposure. As hyperinsulinemia is likely to exert an impact on hepatic lipid metabolism, we carried out this study to establish the effect of chronic MCP exposure (0.9 and 1.8 mg/kg/day for 180 days) on hepatic lipid metabolism in rats. The state of IR induced by MCP in rats was associated with an increase in the liver lipid content (triglyceride and cholesterol) and expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, PPARγ, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase in the liver. Similarly, activities of key enzymes (acetyl-COA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, lipin 1, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which regulate lipogenesis, were enhanced in livers of pesticide-treated rats. A strong correlation was observed between insulin levels, hepatic lipid content, and plasma lipid profile in treated rats. Our study suggests that long-term exposure to OPIs not only has a propensity to induce a state of hyperinsulinemic IR, but it is also associated with augmented hepatic lipogenesis, which may explain dyslipidemia induced by chronic exposure to MCP. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Nanoparticle (NP) exposure might promote hepatic steatosis, but relatively few studies investigated the influence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in vitro. This study investigated lipid accumulation and the possible role of lipophagy (autophagic degradation of lipid droplets) in MWCNT-exposed HepG2 cells. Pristine (XFM19) and carboxylated MWCNTs (XFM21) were internalized, accompanying cytotoxicity, lysosomal destabilization, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Compared with XFM21, XFM19 promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells more effectively, which was further enhanced by pre-incubation with autophagy inhibitor NH4Cl. In addition, MWCNTs increased the expression of lipophagy genes PLIN2 and BECN1 but decreased that of ATG7. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulators, namely DDIT3, HSPA5, and XBP-1s, was also altered in MWCNT exposed HepG2 cells. Combined, these results suggested that MWCNT exposure might promote lipid accumulation in hepatocytes probably through the modulation of lipophagy pathway.",

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases in the world and is a typical hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome which is characterized with lipid accumulation in liver. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been recently identified as an enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis and plays an important role in cellular metabolism in variety of organs in mammals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAMPT on high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. METHODS: Hepatic steatosis model was induced by high fat diet (HFD) in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes were transfected with NAMPT vector plasmid or treated with NAMPT inhibitor FK866 and then incubated with oleic acid. Lipids accumulation was examined by HE staining or oil red staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure expressions of the genes involved in lipogenic synthesis. RESULTS: FK866 significantly promoted liver steatosis in the mice fed with HFD and hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro, accompanied by the increases of the expressions of lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NAD+ significantly rescued the actions of FK866 in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of NAMPT in HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, FK866 decreased the protein levels of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPKα in liver of the HFD fed mice. Furthermore, Resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, significantly reduced lipogenic gene expressions, while EX-527, a Sirt1 specific inhibitor, had the opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT aggravated the HFD- or oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis through suppressing Sirt1-mediated signaling pathway. On the one hand, the inhibition of NAMPT reduced the production of NAD+ through inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway, resulting in the decrease of Sirt1 activity, and then attenuated the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1 activity promoted the expressions of FASN and ACC. On the other hand, the reduced Sirt1 activity alleviated the activation of AMPKα to further enhance SREBP1 activities. PMCID: PMC5408374",

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases in the world and is a typical hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome which is characterized with lipid accumulation in liver. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been recently identified as an enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis and plays an important role in cellular metabolism in variety of organs in mammals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAMPT on high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. METHODS: Hepatic steatosis model was induced by high fat diet (HFD) in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes were transfected with NAMPT vector plasmid or treated with NAMPT inhibitor FK866 and then incubated with oleic acid. Lipids accumulation was examined by HE staining or oil red staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure expressions of the genes involved in lipogenic synthesis. RESULTS: FK866 significantly promoted liver steatosis in the mice fed with HFD and hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro, accompanied by the increases of the expressions of lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NAD+ significantly rescued the actions of FK866 in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of NAMPT in HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, FK866 decreased the protein levels of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPKα in liver of the HFD fed mice. Furthermore, Resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, significantly reduced lipogenic gene expressions, while EX-527, a Sirt1 specific inhibitor, had the opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT aggravated the HFD- or oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis through suppressing Sirt1-mediated signaling pathway. On the one hand, the inhibition of NAMPT reduced the production of NAD+ through inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway, resulting in the decrease of Sirt1 activity, and then attenuated the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1 activity promoted the expressions of FASN and ACC. On the other hand, the reduced Sirt1 activity alleviated the activation of AMPKα to further enhance SREBP1 activities. PMCID: PMC5408374",

Electronic address: tunjilaw@unilorin.edu.ng. Fatty liver is the hepatic consequence of chronic insulin resistance (IR) and related syndromes. It is mostly accompanied by inflammatory and oxidative molecules. Increased activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) exerts both inflammatory and oxidative effects and has been implicated in metabolic derangements including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) elicit beneficial metabolic alterations in IR and related syndromes. In the present study, we evaluated the preventive effects of a SCFA, acetate, on nicotine-induced dysmetabolism and fatty liver. Twenty-four male Wistar rats (n = 6/group): vehicle-treatment (p.o.), nicotine-treated (1.0 mg/kg; p.o.), sodium acetate-treated (200 mg/kg; p.o.) and nicotine + sodium acetate-treated groups. The treatments lasted for 8 weeks. IR was estimated by oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Plasma and hepatic free fatty acid, triglyceride (TG), glutathione peroxidase, adenosine deaminase (ADA), XO and uric acid (UA) were measured. Nicotine exposure resulted in reduced body weight, liver weight, visceral adiposity, glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity. Conversely, exposure to nicotine increased fasting plasma glucose, lactate, IR, plasma and hepatic TG, free fatty acid, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, lipid peroxidation, liver function enzymes, plasma and hepatic UA, XO and ADA activities. However, plasma and hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-dependent antioxidant defense was not affected by nicotine. Concomitant treatment with acetate ameliorated nicotine-induced effects. Taken together, these results indicate that nicotine exposure leads to excess deposition of lipid in the liver by enhancing XO activity. The results also imply that acetate confers hepatoprotection and is accompanied by decreased XO activity.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recognized as the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Overnutrition and obesity are associated with hepatic steatosis. G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) has not been extensively studied in hepatic steatosis, although its endogenous ligands have been implicated in liver disease progression. Therefore, the functions of GPR55 were investigated in Hep3B human hepatoma cells and mice fed high-fat diets. O-1602, the most potent agonist of GPR55, induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which was reversed by treatment with CID16020046, an antagonist of GPR55. O-1602 also induced intracellular calcium rise in Hep3B cells in a GPR55-independent manner. O-1602-induced lipid accumulation was dependent on the PI3 kinase/Akt/SREBP-1c signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found increased levels of lysophosphatidylinositol species of 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 20:1, and 20:2 in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. One-week treatment with CID16020046 suppressed high-fat diet-induced lipid accumulation and O-1602-induced increase of serum triglyceride levels in vivo.

Electronic address: xiecen@simm.ac.cn. In addition to maintaining bile acid, cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) also regulates fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). To explore the different roles of hepatic and intestinal FXR in liver FAO, FAO-associated metabolites, including acylcarnitines and fatty acids, and FXR target gene mRNAs were profiled using an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis in control (Fxrfl/fl), liver-specific Fxr-null (FxrΔHep) and intestine-specific Fxr-null (FxrΔIE) mice, treated either with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) or vehicle (VEH). Activation of FXR by OCA treatment significantly increased fatty acyl-CoA hydrolysis (Acot1) and decreased FAO-associated mRNAs in Fxrfl/fl mice, resulting in reduced levels of total acylcarnitines and relative accumulation of long/medium chain acylcarnitines and fatty acids in liver. FxrΔHep mice responded to OCA treatment in a manner similar to Fxrfl/fl mice while FxrΔIE mice responded differently, thus illustrating that intestinal FXR plays a critical role in the regulation of hepatic FAO. A significant negative-correlation between intestinal FXR-FGF15 and hepatic CREB-PGC1A pathways was observed after both VEH and OCA treatment, suggesting that OCA-induced activation of the intestinal FXR-FGF15 axis downregulates hepatic PGC1α signaling via inactivation of hepatic CREB, thus repressing FAO. This mechanism was confirmed in experiments based on human recombinant FGF19 treatment and intestinal Fgf15-null mice.

Ochratoxin A(OTA) is considered to be one of the most important contaminants of food and feed worldwide. The liver is one of key target organs for OTA to exert its toxic effects. Due to current lifestyle and diet, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been the most common liver disease. To examine the potential effect of OTA on hepatic lipid metabolism and NAFLD, C57BL/6 male mice received 1 mg/kg OTA by gavage daily. Compared with controls, OTA increased lipid deposition and TG accumulation in mouse livers. In vitro OTA treatment also promoted lipid droplets accumulation in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, OTA prevented PPARγ degradation by reducing the interaction between PPARγ and its E3 ligase SIAH2, which led to activation of PPARγ signaling pathway. Furthermore, downregulation or inhibition of CD36, a known of PPARγ, alleviated OTA-induced lipid droplets deposition and TG accumulation. Therefore, OTA induces hepatic steatosis via PPARγ-CD36 axis, suggesting that OTA has an impact on liver lipid metabolism and may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases.

Octyl gallate (OG) is an antioxidant commonly used in food, although there is no definition of its acceptable daily intake. There are reports in vitro and in vivo showing that food additives and drugs can alter lipid metabolism. Lipid droplet accumulation in hepatic cells is one of the main findings in the unregulated lipid metabolism and is strongly related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we investigated the effects of OG on lipid metabolism in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). The results have shown, for the first time, that treatment with OG increased the overall amount of lipids, the triglyceride concentration, the lipid droplet area, and SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ gene expression. Taken together, the findings indicate that OG induces lipid droplet accumulation in HepG2 cells through the regulation of SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ gene expression without involving mTOR/S6K1 and may contribute to NAFLD when used as a food additive.

Electronic address: yuhao@sitcm.edu.au. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The modified Longdan Xiegan Tang (mLXT) has been used clinically for various neuropsychiatric disorders and liver diseases. The use of antipsychotics is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of mLXT on antipsychotic-induced fatty liver. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The representative active components in the formula were identified and quantified by a HPLC method. Fatty liver in male rats was induced by olanzapine (5 mg/kg) (p.o., × 8 weeks), and the rats were co-treated with mLXT extract (50 and 500 mg/kg). Blood and liver variables were determined enzymatically or histologically. Gene/protein expression was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Treatment of rats with mLXT decreased olanzapine-induced increases in hepatic triglyceride content, cell vacuolar degeneration and Oil Red O-stained area, accompanied by suppression of olanzapine-stimulated hepatic mRNA and/or protein overexpression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, and its downstream lipogenic enzymes for de novo lipogenesis. Besides, mLXT also activated hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and its target genes associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation, phosphorylated Thr172 in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-alpha (the upstream enzyme of SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha), and its ratio to total AMPK-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that chronic treatment with mLXT ameliorates olanzapine-induced fatty liver by regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis- and fatty acid beta-oxidation-associated gene expression mediated by SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha, respectively, through activation of AMPK-alpha. Our findings provide the evidence that supports clinical use of the formula for antipsychotic medication-induced fatty liver.",

However, it has been found to have deleterious effects on human health and on the environment. Indeed, its massive use has raised the issue of possible health risks for agrarian communities; the molecule can also reach human cells via the food chain and alter metabolism, endocrine activity and cell survival. In particular, mancozeb induces many toxic effects on hepatic cell metabolism. For this reason, we investigated its effect in an in vitro model of hepatic damage, namely fatty acid-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the HepG2 cell line. We found that the hepatic toxicity of the fungicide exacerbated fatty acid-induced steatosis, as manifested by an increase in intracellular lipid droplet accumulation. Furthermore, mancozeb altered cell metabolism and induced cell death through upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c, respectively, in dose-dependent manners. Therefore, mancozeb may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic disease in humans and represents a danger for human health in high doses.",

Ginkgolide C, isolated from Ginkgo biloba, is a diterpene lactone that has multiple biological functions and can improve Alzheimer disease and platelet aggregation. Ginkgolide C also inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study evaluated whether ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and regulated the molecular mechanism of lipogenesis in oleic acid-induced HepG2 hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM oleic acid for 48 h to induce a fatty liver cell model. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of ginkgolide C for 24 h. Staining with Oil Red O and the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 revealed that ginkgolide C significantly reduced excessive lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Ginkgolide C decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c to block the expression of fatty acid synthase. Ginkgolide C treatment also promoted the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation level of hormone-sensitive lipase to enhance the decomposition of triglycerides. In addition, ginkgolide C stimulated CPT-1 to activate fatty acid β-oxidation, significantly increased sirt1 and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for suppressed fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis through the sirt1/AMPK pathway in oleic acid-induced fatty liver cells. PMCID: PMC6260475",

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases in the world and is a typical hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome which is characterized with lipid accumulation in liver. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been recently identified as an enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis and plays an important role in cellular metabolism in variety of organs in mammals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAMPT on high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. METHODS: Hepatic steatosis model was induced by high fat diet (HFD) in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes were transfected with NAMPT vector plasmid or treated with NAMPT inhibitor FK866 and then incubated with oleic acid. Lipids accumulation was examined by HE staining or oil red staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure expressions of the genes involved in lipogenic synthesis. RESULTS: FK866 significantly promoted liver steatosis in the mice fed with HFD and hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro, accompanied by the increases of the expressions of lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NAD+ significantly rescued the actions of FK866 in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of NAMPT in HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, FK866 decreased the protein levels of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPKα in liver of the HFD fed mice. Furthermore, Resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, significantly reduced lipogenic gene expressions, while EX-527, a Sirt1 specific inhibitor, had the opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT aggravated the HFD- or oleic acid-induced hepatic steatosis through suppressing Sirt1-mediated signaling pathway. On the one hand, the inhibition of NAMPT reduced the production of NAD+ through inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway, resulting in the decrease of Sirt1 activity, and then attenuated the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1 activity promoted the expressions of FASN and ACC. On the other hand, the reduced Sirt1 activity alleviated the activation of AMPKα to further enhance SREBP1 activities. PMCID: PMC5408374",

Hepatic lipid accumulation and apoptosis is elevated in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and is closely associated with severity. Saturated fatty acid palmitate stimulates lipid accumulation and apoptosis in hepatocytes. In the present study, we examined bee-bee tree oil (BO)-mediated protective effects on palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and apoptosis in mouse primary hepatocytes. Cells were cultured in a control media or the same media containing 150 or 300 µmol/L of albumin-bound palmitate for 24 h. BO concentrations used were 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5%. Palmitate induced lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c and SCD1. However, BO prevented these changes. Furthermore, palmitate stimulated caspase-3 activity and decreased cell viability in the absence of BO. BO reduced palmitate-induced activation of caspase-3 and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitors abolished the effects of BO. Furthermore, BO suppressed palmitate-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the 5&apos; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BO attenuated palmitate-induced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis through AMPK-mediated suppression of JNK signaling. These data suggest that BO is an important determinant of saturated fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation and apoptosis, and may be an effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of obesity-mediated liver diseases. © 2018 S.

Obesity is closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and elevated serum palmitate is the link between obesity and excessive hepatic lipid accumulation. Forkhead box O-1 (FoxO1) is one of the FoxO family members of transcription factors and can stimulate adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and suppress its inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) expression in the liver. However, previous researches have also shown conflicting results regarding the role of FoxO1 in hepatic lipid accumulation. We therefore examined the role of FoxO1 as a downstream suppressor to palmitate-stimulated hepatic steatosis. Palmitate significantly promoted lipid accumulation but inhibited lipid decomposition in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Palmitate also significantly reduced FoxO1, ATGL and its activator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) expression but increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) and its target gene G0S2 expression. FoxO1 overexpression significantly increased palmitate-inhibited ATGL and CGI-58 expression but reduced palmitate-stimulated PPARγ and its target gene G0S2 expression. FoxO1 overexpression also inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted lipolysis in palmitate-treated hepatocytes. Overall, these results indicate that FoxO1-mediated ATGL-dependent lipolysis may be an effective molecular mechanism in protecting hepatocytes from palmitate-induced fat accumulation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fermented soymilk (FSM) and soymilk (SM) on free fatty acid-induced lipogenesis in the hepatocellular steatosis model. HepG2 cells were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h to induce lipogenesis and accumulation of intracellular lipid contents. The PA-treated cells were co-incubated with FSM, SM, genistein, and estrogen, respectively. Lipid accumulation in the PA-treated HpG2 cells was significantly decreased by co-incubation with FSM. Treatment of HepG2 cells with PA combined with genistein or estrogen significantly increased the expression of SREBP-1. However, FSM co-incubation significantly attenuated SREBP-1 expression in the PA-treated HepG2 cells; in addition, expression of NRF-2 and phosphorylation of ERK were significantly increased in the PA and FSM co-incubated cells. PA-induced ROS production was significantly reduced by FSM and SM. Our results suggested that the bioactive components of FSM could protect hepatocytes against the lipid accumulation and ROS production induced by free fatty acids.

(#)Contributed equally Silibinin is a flavonoid that improves fatty liver and insulin resistance. To elucidate the effect of silibinin on lipid deposition and the potential molecular mechanism, the present study conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. In the in vivo experiments, mice were randomly divided into control, high‑fat and silibinin groups, while HepG2 cells were randomly divided into control, palmitic acid intervention and silibinin intervention groups. The mRNA, protein and miR‑122 expression associated with hepatic lipid metabolism were detected in each group. The results demonstrated that silibinin reduced the triglyceride content, miR‑122 expression and the mRNA and protein expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACC). Silibinin increased the mRNA and protein expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A). In the present study, HepG2 cells cultured with palmitate were treated with silibinin following overexpression of micro RNA (miR) 122. The results demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression of FAS and ACC was increased, while that of CPT1A was decreased. Therefore, it could be deduced that silibinin improved lipid metabolism by reducing the expression of miR‑122 and inhibiting the expression of miR‑122 may be a new therapeutic target to improve fatty liver disease.

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Electronic address: ccalhau@nms.unl.pt. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are chemicals employed to lower the flammability of several objects. These endocrine disruptor chemicals are lipophilic and persistent in the environment. Due to these characteristics some have been restricted or banned by the European Union, and replaced by several new chemicals, the novel BFRs (NBFRs). BFRs are widely detected in human samples, such as adipose tissue and some were linked with altered thyroid hormone levels, liver toxicity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome in humans. However, the disturbance in lipid metabolism caused by BFRs with emphases to NBFRs remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a pre-adipocyte (3T3-L1) cell line and a hepatocyte (HepG2) cell line to investigate the possible lipid metabolism disruption caused by four BFRs: hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromotoluene (PBT), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). For that purpose, proliferation and Oil Red O assays, as well as, medium fatty acids profile evaluation using Gas chromatography and RNA extraction for quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed. We detected a significant reduction in the proliferation of preadipocytes and an increased lipid accumulation during differentiation caused by HBB. This BFR also lead to a significant increased expression of IL-1β and decreased expression of PGC-1α and adiponectin. Nevertheless, PBT, TBB and HBCD show to increase lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. PBT also display a significant increase of PPARγ gene expression. Lipid accumulation in the cells can occur by diverse mechanisms depending on the BFR. These results highlight the importance of endocrine disruptor compounds in obesity etiopathogeny.",

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, have been extensively used for over 50 years. A growing body of evidence has emerged demonstrating the potential adverse effects of these substances, including its effect on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases. Nonetheless, there is no report of effects of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, the major replacement for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, the effects of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid exposure on fat accumulation in a human hepatoma cell line were examined. Cells were exposed to perfluorobutanesulfonic acid with or without 300 μmol/L fatty acid mixture (oleic acid:palmitic acid = 2:1) conjugated by bovine serum albumin as an inducer of steatosis for 48 hours. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid at 200 μmol/L significantly increased the triglyceride level in the presence of fatty acid compared to the control, but not without fatty acid, which was abolished by a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonist. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid upregulated key genes controlling lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid treatment also promoted the production of reactive oxygen species, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker and cytosolic calcium. In conclusion, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid increased fat accumulation, in part, via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated pathway in hepatoma cells. PMCID: PMC7986581",

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, have been extensively used for over 50 years. A growing body of evidence has emerged demonstrating the potential adverse effects of these substances, including its effect on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases. Nonetheless, there is no report of effects of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, the major replacement for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, the effects of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid exposure on fat accumulation in a human hepatoma cell line were examined. Cells were exposed to perfluorobutanesulfonic acid with or without 300 μmol/L fatty acid mixture (oleic acid:palmitic acid = 2:1) conjugated by bovine serum albumin as an inducer of steatosis for 48 hours. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid at 200 μmol/L significantly increased the triglyceride level in the presence of fatty acid compared to the control, but not without fatty acid, which was abolished by a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonist. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid upregulated key genes controlling lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid treatment also promoted the production of reactive oxygen species, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker and cytosolic calcium.

Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid metabolism responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.",

The underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by chronic PFOS exposure are still largely unknown. The present study defined the effects of chronic exposure to low level of PFOS on lipid metabolism using zebrafish as a model system. Our findings revealed a severe hepatic steatosis in the liver of males treated with 0.5μM PFOS as evidenced by hepatosomatic index, histological assessment and liver lipid profiles. Quantitative PCR assay further indicated that PFOS significantly increase the transcriptional expression of nuclear receptors (nr1h3, rara, rxrgb, nr1l2) and the genes associated with fatty acid oxidation (acox1, acadm, cpt1a). In addition, chronic PFOS exposure significantly decreased liver ATP content and serum level of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein in males. Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic PFOS exposure induces hepatic steatosis in zebrafish via disturbing lipid biosynthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation and excretion of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein, and also demonstrate the validity of using zebrafish as an alternative model for PFOS chronic toxicity screening.",

Electronic address: yangdongren@yahoo.com. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), one persistent organic pollutant, has been widely detected in the environment, wildlife and human. Currently few studies have documented the effects of chronic PFOS exposure on lipid metabolism, especially in aquatic organisms. The underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by chronic PFOS exposure are still largely unknown. The present study defined the effects of chronic exposure to low level of PFOS on lipid metabolism using zebrafish as a model system. Our findings revealed a severe hepatic steatosis in the liver of males treated with 0.5μM PFOS as evidenced by hepatosomatic index, histological assessment and liver lipid profiles. Quantitative PCR assay further indicated that PFOS significantly increase the transcriptional expression of nuclear receptors (nr1h3, rara, rxrgb, nr1l2) and the genes associated with fatty acid oxidation (acox1, acadm, cpt1a). In addition, chronic PFOS exposure significantly decreased liver ATP content and serum level of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein in males. Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic PFOS exposure induces hepatic steatosis in zebrafish via disturbing lipid biosynthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation and excretion of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein, and also demonstrate the validity of using zebrafish as an alternative model for PFOS chronic toxicity screening.",

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), have been showed to induce obesogenic effects which may last over generations. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear. In the present study, wild-type N2 Caenorhabditis elegans and the daf-2 mutant were exposed to PFOA for 4 consecutive generations (F0 to F3) at 1.0 ng/L. Effects on fat content and fat metabolism in the directly exposed F0 to F3 generations, the offspring of F0 (T1 to T3) and also those of F3 (T1' to T3'). Results showed that PFOA significantly stimulated the fat contents in F0 (with the percentage of the control as 184.1%), T1 (189.5%), F1 (167.3%), F2 (238.0%), T2' (193.9%) and T3' (159.4%) while inhibited them in T3 (70%). The changes of fat contents over generations were accompanied with significant changes in enzymes facilitating fatty acid synthesis (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and desaturase, and glycerol phosphate acyltransferase) and those in fatty acid consumption (e.g., acetyl CoA synthetase, fatty acid transport protein, acyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase). Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis was performed on F0, F3 and T3 generations. Based on the KEGG analysis of differential genes, PFOA exposure affected lipid metabolism signaling pathways including MAPK, fatty acid degradation, TGF-β signaling pathways. Notably, PFOA exposure provoked significantly different effects in daf-2 nematodes on fat contents, lipid metabolizing enzymes and even different signaling pathways. The overall results demonstrated that the obesogenic effects of PFOA were resulted from a complex combination of various enzymes and pathways with essential involvement of insulin signaling pathway.",

Increasing evidences show that ubiquitous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a representative environmental pollutant, is found to be linked to lipid dysmetabolism. However, the biological mechanism behind this outcome remains uninvestigated. In the present study, we established the PFOA-injured liver in mice to explore the underlying mechanism associated with PFOA-induced lipid disturbance in the liver via a group of biochemical and molecular assays. As results, PFOA-exposed mice showed increased transaminase (ALT), reduced triglyceride and free fatty acid contents in serum, as well as elevated level of hepatic triglyceride. Morphologically, PFOA-exposed mice displayed visible vacuolation in cytoplasm and abnormal cytoarchitecture in liver. In addition, PFOA-exposed liver showed up-regulated expressions of lipid-uptake associated mRNA of hepatic lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid translocase (CD36) and down-regulated expression of lipid-uptake associated mRNA of apolipoprotein-B100 (APOB). Moreover, validated data from immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting found that hepatocellular LPL and CD36 proteins were increased dose-dependently, and lowered expression of hepatic APOB was observed. In conclusion, our current findings reveal that PFOA-induced lipid dysmetabolism in the liver is involved to dysregulation of fatty acid trafficking.",

Morphologically, PFOA-exposed mice displayed visible vacuolation in cytoplasm and abnormal cytoarchitecture in liver. In addition, PFOA-exposed liver showed up-regulated expressions of lipid-uptake associated mRNA of hepatic lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid translocase (CD36) and down-regulated expression of lipid-uptake associated mRNA of apolipoprotein-B100 (APOB). Moreover, validated data from immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting found that hepatocellular LPL and CD36 proteins were increased dose-dependently, and lowered expression of hepatic APOB was observed. In conclusion, our current findings reveal that PFOA-induced lipid dysmetabolism in the liver is involved to dysregulation of fatty acid trafficking.",

Recent studies have reported the positive association between exposure to insecticides and increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is not known if insecticide exposure can contribute to NAFLD. Thus, the goal of the current study was to determine if insecticide exposures can exacerbate the physiological conditions of NAFLD by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The effects of 12 insecticides on triglycerides (TG) accumulation were tested using palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 hepatoma steatosis model. Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with palmitic acid to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted fatty acid synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited lipogenesis-related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates fatty acid oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive fatty acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.

Phenanthrene (Phe), among the most ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) existing in nature and foodstuffs, has severe effects on hepatic lipids metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism involved is still unknown. For environmental chemicals can disturb intestinal microbiota, which plays a vital role in lipids metabolism, we hypothesized that oral exposure to Phe may disrupt the intestinal microbiota, leading to the induction of an abnormal inflammatory response and lipid metabolism dysfunction. Herein, male mice were orally exposed to Phe (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg/kg/2d) for ten weeks and the results showed that long term exposure to Phe induced significant alteration in relative Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria abundance in male mice. Histopathological anomalies, and significantly increased hepatic levels of free fatty acid, cholesterol and triglyceride were observed as well. The expression of hepatic proteins linked to lipid metabolism including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptor β (LXRβ) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) were upregulated. The importance of the gut microbiota in Phe-altered lipid metabolism disorder was further confirmed by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT intervention boosted microbial diversity and attenuated Phe-induced elevation in liver somatic index and hepatic total lipids levels. These results demonstrated that environmental-level Phe altered the composition of gastrointestinal bacteria and subsequently induced hepatic lipid metabolism disorder. These results would be helpful for understanding the health risk posed by Phe.

Author information: (1)Department of Nutrition Science and Food Hygiene, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, China. Genistein (GEN) has been shown to significantly inhibit hepatic triglyceride accretion triggered by estrogen deficiency. The main purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism induced by GEN. Different doses of GEN or GEN with an ERβ antagonist were treated with HepG2 cells. Results showed that 25 μM GEN significantly diminished triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, GEN downregulated the levels of genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis, such as sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and upregulated the gene and protein levels of the regulation factors responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT-1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Furthermore, 25 μM GEN reduced the levels of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Moreover, most of these effects from GEN were reverted by pretreatment with the antagonist of ERβ. In conclusion, GEN improved hepatic lipid metabolism by activating ERβ and further modulation of Akt/mTOR signals. The results provide novel aspects of the regulatory mechanism of ERβ on hepatic lipid metabolism and might help to profoundly understand the functions of food-derived phytoestrogens in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women.

Author information: (1)Department of Nutrition Science and Food Hygiene, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, China. Genistein (GEN) has been shown to significantly inhibit hepatic triglyceride accretion triggered by estrogen deficiency. The main purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism induced by GEN. Different doses of GEN or GEN with an ERβ antagonist were treated with HepG2 cells. Results showed that 25 μM GEN significantly diminished triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, GEN downregulated the levels of genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis, such as sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and upregulated the gene and protein levels of the regulation factors responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT-1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Furthermore, 25 μM GEN reduced the levels of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Moreover, most of these effects from GEN were reverted by pretreatment with the antagonist of ERβ. In conclusion, GEN improved hepatic lipid metabolism by activating ERβ and further modulation of Akt/mTOR signals. The results provide novel aspects of the regulatory mechanism of ERβ on hepatic lipid metabolism and might help to profoundly understand the functions of food-derived phytoestrogens in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women.

Exposure to ambient particular matters (PM) has been associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Given that microRNA (miRNA) is recognized as a key regulator of lipid metabolism and a potential mediator of environmental cues, this study aimed to explore the role of miRNA-mRNA regulation underlying abnormal lipid metabolism triggered by PM2.5liposoluble extracts. We confirmed that 72-h exposure to liposoluble extracts of PM2.5 from Nanjing at 25 μg/cm2 induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by promoting uptake of free fatty acids (FFAs). Notably, lipid accumulation induced by PM2.5 liposoluble extracts was associated with decreased expression of miR-26a and consequent upregulation of fatty acid translocase (FAT, also known as CD36). Using gain- and loss-of-function assays, we demonstrated that miR-26a negatively regulated CD36 to mediate lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. We further confirmed that miR-26a directly acted on the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of CD36. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-26a abolished steatosis in HepG2 cells treated with PM2.5 liposoluble extracts by suppressing CD36. In addition, we demonstrated that PM2.5 liposoluble extracts caused inflammation in HepG2 cells by raising p65 phosphorylation, thereby fuelling the transition from simple non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a novel mechanism by which miR-26a-CD36 pathway mediated lipid accumulation induced by PM2.5 liposoluble extracts in hepatocytes. Lipid accumulation and inflammation induced by PM2.5 liposoluble extracts implied the potential role of PM2.5 in developing NAFLD.",

Ambient particulate matter (PM) newly has been regarded as a conceivable hazard for public health. A large number of studies have described that PM, exceptionally PM2.5, is correlated with respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases, etc. PM2.5-induced hepatocyte steatosis previously has been uncovered both in cellular and murine models. Nevertheless, less is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we found that PM2.5 could cause the downregulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a key transcription factor for lipid metabolism. FXR could regulate the accumulation of lipid droplets induced by PM2.5 in vitro. Moreover, FXR-/- mice were exposed to PM2.5 for 2 months to investigate the role of FXR in pathogenesis of PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo. The results showed that exposure of wild-type (WT) mice to PM2.5 caused mild liver steatosis compared with the mice exposure to filtered air (FA). Furthermore, the content of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) was elevated in WT mice liver triggered by the inhalation of PM2.5. However, there was no statistical difference in TG and TC content between FXR-/- mice with and without PM2.5 exposure. Overall, our finding suggested FXR mediated PM2.5-induced hepatic steatosis.",

However, the mechanisms are unclear. Because liver is the target organ for PCB toxicity and responsible for metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that early disruption of glucose and lipid homeostasis contributes to later manifestations such as hepatic steatosis. To test this hypothesis, groups of male Sprague Dawley rats, fed on AIN-93G diet, were injected (intraperitoneal.) with a single bolus of PCB126 (5 µmol/kg) at various time intervals between 9 h and 12 days prior to euthanasia. An early decrease in serum glucose and a gradual decrease in serum triglycerides were observed over time. Liver lipid accumulation was most severe at 6 and 12 days of exposure. Transcript levels of cytosolic phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck-c/Pck1) and glucose transporter (Glut2/Slc2a2) involved in gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose transport were time-dependently downregulated between 9 h and 12 days of PCB126 exposure. Additionally, transcript levels of Pparα, and its targets acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1) and hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2), were also downregulated, indicating changes in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. In a separate animal study, we found that the measured changes in the transcript levels of Pepck-c, Glut2, Pparα, Acox1, and Hmgcs2 were also dose dependent. Furthermore, PCB126-induced effects on Pepck-c were demonstrated to be AhR dependent in rat H4IIE hepatocytes. These results indicate that PCB126-induced wasting and steatosis are preceded initially by (1) decreased serum glucose caused by decreased hepatic glucose production, followed by (2) decreased peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. © The Author 2015.

Electronic address: c.zhou@uky.edu. Erratum in J Hepatol. 2021 Apr;74(4):1003-1004. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The most prescribed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, has been associated with elevated risk of dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in HIV-infected patients but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in mediating the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid homeostasis. METHODS: Cell-based reporter assays, primary cell culture, and multiple mouse models including conditional knockout and humanized mice were combined to study the impact of efavirenz on PXR activities and lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. A novel liver-specific Pxr knockout mouse model was also generated to determine the contribution of hepatic PXR signaling to efavirenz-elicited dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: We found that efavirenz is a potent PXR-selective agonist that can efficiently activate PXR and induce its target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with efavirenz-induced hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis in mice but deficiency of hepatic PXR abolished these adverse effects. Interestingly, efavirenz-mediated PXR activation regulated the expression of several key hepatic lipogenic genes including fatty acid transporter CD36 and cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), leading to increased lipid uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatic cells. While CD36 is a known PXR target gene, we identified a DR-2-type of PXR-response element in the SQLE promoter and established SQLE as a direct transcriptional target of PXR. Since PXR exhibits considerable differences in its pharmacology across species, we also confirmed these findings in PXR-humanized mice and human primary hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The widely prescribed antiretroviral drug efavirenz induces hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis by activating PXR signaling. Activation of PXR should be taken into consideration for patients undergoing long-term treatment with PXR agonistic antiretroviral drugs. LAY SUMMARY: Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-infected patients but has some side effects. It can increase lipid levels in patients' blood and liver. Here we show that efavirenz can activate a unique liver protein called PXR which mediates the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid levels in mouse models. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) remains one of the most effective options in treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. Here, we evaluated the relationship among hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT2-insulin-induced gene 2 (Insig2) signaling, lipogenic transcription factors and lipid synthesis enzymes in obese mice with or without RYGB operation. Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic lipogenesis and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high-fat diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis. Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and lipogenesis-related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased oleic acid-induced lipid deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes.

Author information: (1)First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China. (2)Department of Toxicology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China. Previous study found that rifampicin caused intrahepatic cholestasis. This study investigated the effects of rifampicin on hepatic lipid metabolism. Mice were orally administered with rifampicin (200 mg/kg) daily for different periods. Results showed that serum TG level was progressively reduced after a short elevation. By contrast, hepatic TG content was markedly increased in rifampicin-treated mice. An obvious hepatic lipid accumulation, as determined by Oil Red O staining, was observed in mice treated with rifampicin for more than one week. Moreover, mRNA levels of Fas, Acc and Scd-1, several key genes for fatty acid synthesis, were elevated in rifampicin-treated mice. In addition, the class B scavenger receptor CD36 was progressively up-regulated by rifampicin. Interestingly, hepatic SREBP-1c and LXR-α, two important transcription factors that regulate genes for hepatic fatty acid synthesis, were not activated by rifampicin. Instead, hepatic PXR was rapidly activated in rifampicin-treated mice. Hepatic PPARγ, a downstream target of PXR, was transcriptionally up-regulated. Taken together, the increased hepatic lipid synthesis and uptake of fatty acids from circulation into liver jointly contribute to rifampicin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. The increased uptake of fatty acids from circulation into liver might be partially attributed to rifampicin-induced up-regulation of PPARγ and its target genes.

In addition, the class B scavenger receptor CD36 was progressively up-regulated by rifampicin. Interestingly, hepatic SREBP-1c and LXR-α, two important transcription factors that regulate genes for hepatic fatty acid synthesis, were not activated by rifampicin.

Taken together, the increased hepatic lipid synthesis and uptake of fatty acids from circulation into liver jointly contribute to rifampicin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.

Rosiglitazone has been reported to exert dual effects on liver steatosis, and it could exacerbate liver steatosis in obese animal models, which was suggested to be closely related to the elevated hepatic expression of FABP4. This study aimed to investigate whether combined treatment with FABP4 inhibitor I-9 could alleviate rosiglitazone-induced liver steatosis in obese diabetic db/db mice. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were orally treated with rosiglitazone, rosiglitazone combined with I-9 daily for 8 weeks. The liver steatosis was evaluated by triglyceride content and H&E staining. The expression of hepatic lipogenic genes or proteins in liver tissue or in FFA-treated hepatocytes and PMA-stimulated macrophages were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or western blotting.

BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that acute oral administration of schisandrin B (Sch B), an active dibenzocyclooctadiene isolated from Schisandrae Fructus (a commonly used traditional Chinese herb), increased serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic mass in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanism underlying the Sch B-induced hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis and hepatomegaly. METHODS: Male ICR mice were given a single oral dose of Sch B (0.25-2 g/kg). Sch B-induced changes in serum levels of biomarkers, such as TG, total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB 48), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and hepatic growth factor (HGF), as well as hepatic lipids and mass, epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) and adipocyte size, and histological changes of the liver and EAT were examined over a period of 12-120 h after Sch B treatment. RESULTS: Serum and hepatic TG levels were increased by 1.0-4.3 fold and 40-158% at 12-72 h and 12-96 h, respectively, after Sch B administration. Sch B treatment elevated serum ApoB 48 level (up to 12%), a marker of exogenous TG, but not VLDL, as compared with the vehicle treatment. Treatment with Sch B caused a time-/dose-dependent reduction in EAT index (up to 39%) and adipocyte size (up to 67%) and elevation in serum NEFA level (up to 55%). Sch B treatment induced hepatic steatosis in a time-/dose-dependent manner, as indicated by increases in total vacuole area (up to 3.2 fold vs. the vehicle control) and lipid positive staining area (up to 17.5 × 103 μm2) in liver tissue. Hepatic index and serum HGF levels were increased by 18-60% and 42-71% at 12-120 h and 24-72 h post-Sch B dosing, respectively. In addition, ultrastructural changes, such as increase in size and disruption of cristae, in hepatic mitochondria were observed in Sch B-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that exogenous sources of TG and the breakdown of fat storage in the body contribute to Sch B-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in mice. Hepatomegaly (a probable hepatotoxic action) caused by Sch B may result from the fat accumulation and mitochondrial damage in liver tissue. PMCID: PMC5237187",

BACKGROUND: As a promising nanocarrier in biomedical fields, silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) could transfer from the circulatory system to multiple organs. Among these, blood-liver molecular exchange is a critical factor in biological response to NPs. However, the potential effect of SiNPs on hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. In this study, we employed three models to attempt discover whether and how SiNPs disturb hepatic lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Firstly we used ICR mice models to evaulated the effects of SiNPs on the serum and hepatic lipid levels through repeated intravenous administration, meanwhile, the protein expressions of protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS), the key enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation, CPT1A,and leptin levels in liver were detected by western blot. For verification studies, the model organism zebrafish and cultured hepatic L02 cells were further performed. The TLR5 and adipocytokine-signaling pathway were verified. RESULTS: Inflammatory cell infiltration and mild steatosis induced by SiNPs were observed in the liver. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were elevated significantly in both blood serum and liver tissue, whereas the ratio of high-density:low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was markedly decreased. Protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS) were elevated significantly in liver tissue, whereas the key enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation, CPT1A, was decreased significantly. Interestingly, leptin levels in the SiNP-treated group were also elevated markedly. In addition, SiNPs caused hepatic damage and steatosis in zebrafish and enhanced hyperlipemia in high-cholesterol diet zebrafish. Similarly, SiNPs increased the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, IL6, IL8, and TNFα) and activated the TLR5-signaling pathway in hepatic L02 cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study found that SiNPs triggered hyperlipemia and hepatic steatosis via the TLR5-signaling pathway. This suggests that regulation of TLR5 could be a novel therapeutic target to reduce side effects of NPs in living organisms.

There are unprecedented epidemics of obesity, such as type II diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in developed countries. A concerning percentage of American children are being affected by obesity and NAFLD. Studies have suggested that the maternal environment in utero might play a role in the development of these diseases later in life. In this study, we documented that inhibiting SIRT1 signaling in human fetal hepatocytes rapidly led to an increase in intracellular glucose and lipids levels. More importantly, both de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis related genes were upregulated upon SIRT1 inhibition. The AKT/FOXO1 pathway, a major negative regulator of gluconeogenesis, was decreased in the human fetal hepatocytes inhibited for SIRT1, consistent with the higher level of gluconeogenesis. These results indicate that SIRT1 is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms within human fetal hepatocytes, acting as an adaptive transcriptional response to environmental changes.

There are unprecedented epidemics of obesity, such as type II diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in developed countries. A concerning percentage of American children are being affected by obesity and NAFLD. Studies have suggested that the maternal environment in utero might play a role in the development of these diseases later in life. In this study, we documented that inhibiting SIRT1 signaling in human fetal hepatocytes rapidly led to an increase in intracellular glucose and lipids levels. More importantly, both de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis related genes were upregulated upon SIRT1 inhibition. The AKT/FOXO1 pathway, a major negative regulator of gluconeogenesis, was decreased in the human fetal hepatocytes inhibited for SIRT1, consistent with the higher level of gluconeogenesis. These results indicate that SIRT1 is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms within human fetal hepatocytes, acting as an adaptive transcriptional response to environmental changes.

Steatosis is the characteristic type of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and may result in life-threatening hepatic lesion. Approximately 61% of patients treated with VPA have been diagnosed with hepatic steatosis through ultrasound examination. However, the mechanisms underlying VPA-induced intracellular fat accumulation are not yet fully understood. Here we demonstrated the involvement of fatty acid uptake and lipogenesis in VPA-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting analysis, fatty acid uptake assays, Nile Red staining assays, and Oil Red O staining assays. Specifically, we found that the expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), an important fatty acid transport, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were significantly up-regulated in HepG2 cells and livers of C57B/6J mice after treatment with VPA. Furthermore, VPA treatment remarkably enhanced the efficiency of fatty acid uptake mediated by CD36, while this effect was abolished by the interference with CD36-specific siRNA. Also, VPA treatment significantly increased DGAT2 expression as a result of the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) - extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway; however, DGAT2 knockdown significantly alleviated VPA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation. Additionally, we also found that sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)-mediated fatty acid synthesis may be not involved in VPA-induced hepatic steatosis. Overall, VPA-triggered over-regulation of CD36 and DGAT2 could be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying VPA-induced hepatic steatosis and may offer novel therapeutic strategies to combat VPA-induced hepatotoxicity.",

Steatosis is the characteristic type of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and may result in life-threatening hepatic lesion. Approximately 61% of patients treated with VPA have been diagnosed with hepatic steatosis through ultrasound examination. However, the mechanisms underlying VPA-induced intracellular fat accumulation are not yet fully understood. Here we demonstrated the involvement of fatty acid uptake and lipogenesis in VPA-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting analysis, fatty acid uptake assays, Nile Red staining assays, and Oil Red O staining assays. Specifically, we found that the expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), an important fatty acid transport, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were significantly up-regulated in HepG2 cells and livers of C57B/6J mice after treatment with VPA. Furthermore, VPA treatment remarkably enhanced the efficiency of fatty acid uptake mediated by CD36, while this effect was abolished by the interference with CD36-specific siRNA. Also, VPA treatment significantly increased DGAT2 expression as a result of the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) - extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway; however, DGAT2 knockdown significantly alleviated VPA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation. Additionally, we also found that sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)-mediated fatty acid synthesis may be not involved in VPA-induced hepatic steatosis. Overall, VPA-triggered over-regulation of CD36 and DGAT2 could be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying VPA-induced hepatic steatosis and may offer novel therapeutic strategies to combat VPA-induced hepatotoxicity.",

High-fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) has been suggested to be more lipogenic than sucrose, which increases the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and dyslipidemia. The study objectives were to determine the effects of drinking different sugar-sweetened solutions on hepatic gene expression in relation to liver fatty acid composition and risk of NAFLD. Female rats were randomly assigned (n=7 rats/group) to drink water or water sweetened with 13% (w/v) HFCS-55, sucrose or fructose for 8 weeks. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest (P=.03) hepatic total lipid and triglyceride content and histological evidence of fat infiltration. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest hepatic de novo lipogenesis indicated by the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and the highest (P<.001) oleic acid (18:1n-9) content. This was accompanied by reduced β-oxidation indicated by down-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Disposal of excess lipids by export of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein from the liver was increased as shown by up-regulation of gene expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in rats drinking sucrose, but not HFCS-55 solution. The observed lipogenic effects were attributed to the slightly higher fructose content of HFCS-55 solution in the absence of differences in macronutrient and total caloric intake between rats drinking HFCS-55 and sucrose solution. Results from gene expression and fatty acid composition analysis showed that, in a hypercaloric state, some types of sugars are more detrimental to the liver. Based on these preclinical study results, excess consumption of caloric sweetened beverage, particularly HFCS-sweetened beverages, should be limited. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Protective effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been demonstrated. FFA4 (also known as GPR120; a G protein-coupled receptor) has been suggested to be a target of n-3 PUFA. FFA4 expression in hepatocytes has also been reported from liver biopsies in child fatty liver patients. In order to assess the functional role of FFA4 in hepatic steatosis, we used an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis. FFA4 expression was confirmed in Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. T0901317 (a specific LXR activator) induced lipid accumulation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a representative n-3 PUFA) inhibited lipid accumulation. This DHA-induced inhibition was blunted by treatment of AH7614 (a FFA4 antagonist) and by transfection of FFA4 siRNA. SREBP-1c (a key transcription factor of lipogenesis) was induced by treatment with T0901317, and SREBP-1c induction was also inhibited by DHA at mRNA and protein levels. DHA-induced suppression of SREBP-1c expression was also blunted by FFA4-knockdown. Furthermore, DHA inhibited T0901317-induced lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes from wild type mice, but not in those from FFA4 deficient mice. In addition, DHA-induced activations of Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, and AMPK were found to be signaling components of the steatosis protective pathway. The results of this study suggest that n-3 PUFA protect hepatic steatosis by activating FFA4 in hepatocytes, and its signaling cascade sequentially involves FFA4, Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, AMPK, and SREBP-1c suppression.",

Protective effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been demonstrated. FFA4 (also known as GPR120; a G protein-coupled receptor) has been suggested to be a target of n-3 PUFA. FFA4 expression in hepatocytes has also been reported from liver biopsies in child fatty liver patients. In order to assess the functional role of FFA4 in hepatic steatosis, we used an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis. FFA4 expression was confirmed in Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. T0901317 (a specific LXR activator) induced lipid accumulation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a representative n-3 PUFA) inhibited lipid accumulation. This DHA-induced inhibition was blunted by treatment of AH7614 (a FFA4 antagonist) and by transfection of FFA4 siRNA. SREBP-1c (a key transcription factor of lipogenesis) was induced by treatment with T0901317, and SREBP-1c induction was also inhibited by DHA at mRNA and protein levels. DHA-induced suppression of SREBP-1c expression was also blunted by FFA4-knockdown. Furthermore, DHA inhibited T0901317-induced lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes from wild type mice, but not in those from FFA4 deficient mice. In addition, DHA-induced activations of Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, and AMPK were found to be signaling components of the steatosis protective pathway. The results of this study suggest that n-3 PUFA protect hepatic steatosis by activating FFA4 in hepatocytes, and its signaling cascade sequentially involves FFA4, Gq/11 proteins, CaMKK, AMPK, and SREBP-1c suppression.",

Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the progression of hepatic steatosis is important for identifying new therapeutic targets against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the functional role of histone demethylase JMJD2B in the pathologic regulation of hepatic steatosis. JMJD2B expression was markedly increased in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate and oleate or liver X receptor agonist T09013178 and in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Overexpression of JMJD2B using adenovirus in HepG2 cells stimulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and its steatosis target genes associated with fatty acid uptake and lipid droplet formation, resulting in increased intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Conversely, knocking down JMJD2B using siRNA reversed JMJD2B-mediated effects in HepG2 cells. The JMJD2B-dependent upregulation of PPARγ2 was associated with the removal of di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 on the promoter of PPARγ2. Furthermore, exogeneous expression of JMJD2B using adenovirus in mice resulted in hepatic steatosis when fed a HFD, which was accompanied with increased expression of hepatic PPARγ2 and its steatosis target genes. Together, our results provide novel insights into the pivotal role of JMJD2B in the development of hepatic steatosis through upregulation of PPARγ2 and steatosis target genes.

Author information: (1)Peking University Fifth School of Clinical Medicine (Beijing Hospital), Beijing, China. (2)The Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics &Beijing Hospital, Ministry of Health, Beijing, China. Hepatic steatosis is strongly linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. GPR40 is a G protein-coupled receptor mediating free fatty acid-induced insulin secretion and thus plays a beneficial role in the improvement of diabetes. However, the impact of GPR40 agonist on hepatic steatosis still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we found that activation of GPR40 by its agonist GW9508 attenuated Liver X receptor (LXR)-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Activation of LXR in the livers of C57BL/6 mice fed a high-cholesterol diet and in HepG2 cells stimulated by chemical agonist caused increased expression of its target lipogenic genes and subsequent lipid accumulation. All these effects of LXR were dramatically downregulated after GW9508 supplementation. Moreover, GPR40 activation was accompanied by upregulation of AMPK pathway, whereas the inhibitive effect of GPR40 on the lipogenic gene expression was largely abrogated by AMPK knockdown. Taken together, our results demonstrated that GW9508 exerts a beneficial effect to ameliorate LXR-induced hepatic steatosis through regulation of AMPK signaling pathway. PMCID: PMC4848522",

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Background and Aims: Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to fatty liver. However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis. Methods: Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls. Results: We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., irbesartan, fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade. Conclusion: Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5263149",

In real life, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals at low concentration levels, whereas research on toxicological effects is mostly focused on single compounds at comparably high doses. Mixture effects deviating from the assumption of additivity, especially synergistic effects, are of concern. In an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-guided manner, we analyzed the accumulation of triglycerides in human HepaRG liver cells by a mixture of eight steatotic chemicals (amiodarone, benzoic acid, cyproconazole, flusilazole, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole), each present below its individual effect concentration at 1-3 μM. Pronounced and significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation was observed with the mixture, and similar effects were seen at the level of pregnane-X-receptor activation, a molecular initiating event leading to hepatic steatosis. Transcript pattern analysis indicated subtle pro-steatotic changes at low compound concentrations, which did not exert measurable effects on cellular triglycerides. Mathematical modeling of mixture effects indicated potentially more than additive behavior using a model for compounds with similar modes of action. The present data underline the usefulness of AOP-guided in vitro testing for the identification of mixture effects and highlight the need for further research on chemical mixtures and harmonization of data interpretation of mixture effects.",

Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects of TEB on lipid metabolism and accumulation in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were exposed to 0-320 µM TEB for 1-24 h. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h)-treated cells showed lipid accumulation. Further, TEB (20-80 µM, 1-12 h) increased the nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the expression of lipid uptake and oxidation-related markers such as cluster of differentiation 36, fatty acid transport protein (FATP) 2, FATP5, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. Oxidative stress levels in TEB-treated cells (20-80 µM, 24 h) were higher, compared to those in the control. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h) also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and lower levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in the cells. Thus, TEB can induce lipid accumulation by altering the expression of lipid-metabolizing molecules and can therefore impair lipid metabolism.

Tebuconazole (TEB), a triazole fungicide, is frequently applied to agriculture for the increase of food production. Although TEB causes liver toxicity, its effects on cellular lipid accumulation are rarely investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects of TEB on lipid metabolism and accumulation in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were exposed to 0-320 µM TEB for 1-24 h. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h)-treated cells showed lipid accumulation. Further, TEB (20-80 µM, 1-12 h) increased the nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the expression of lipid uptake and oxidation-related markers such as cluster of differentiation 36, fatty acid transport protein (FATP) 2, FATP5, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. Oxidative stress levels in TEB-treated cells (20-80 µM, 24 h) were higher, compared to those in the control. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h) also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and lower levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in the cells. Thus, TEB can induce lipid accumulation by altering the expression of lipid-metabolizing molecules and can therefore impair lipid metabolism. Our data suggest that human exposure to TEB may be a risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is known to be involved in the development of several metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tetracycline can cause hepatic steatosis, and ER stress may be involved in tetracycline-induced fatty liver. Our previous study showed that bicyclol has been proven to protect against tetracycline-induced fatty liver in mice, and ER stress may also be involved in bicyclol's hepatoprotective effect. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with ER stress and apoptosis, by which bicyclol attenuated tetracycline-induced fatty liver in mice. Bicyclol (300 mg/kg) was given to mice by gavage 3 times. Tetracycline (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was injected at 1 h after the last dose of bicyclol. At 6 h and 24 h after single dose of tetracycline injection, serum ALT, AST, TG, CHO and hepatic histopathological examinations were performed to evaluate liver injuries. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by the accumulation of hepatic TG and CHO. Moreover, hepatic apoptosis and ER stress related markers were determined by TUNEL, real-time PCR, and western blot. As a result, bicyclol significantly protected against tetracycline-induced fatty liver as evidenced by the decrease of elevated serum transaminases and hepatic triglyceride, and the attenuation of histopathological changes in mice. In addition, bicyclol remarkably alleviated hepatic apoptosis and the gene expression of caspase-3, and increased the gene expression of XIAP. The gene expressions of ER stress-related markers, including CHOP, GRP78, IRE-1α, and ATF6, which were downregulated by bicyclol pretreatment in tetracycline-injected mice. These results suggested that bicyclol protected tetracycline-induced fatty liver partly due to its ability of anti-apoptosis associated with ER stress.",

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methyl donor supplementation has been shown to alleviate NAFLD, connecting the condition to the one-carbon metabolism. Thus, the objective was to investigate regulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and metabolites along the choline oxidation pathway during induction of hepatic steatosis by the fatty acid analogue tetradecylthiopropionic acid (TTP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. METHODS: Mice were fed a control diet, or diets containing 0.3 %, 0.6 %, or 0.9 % (w/w) TTP for 14 days. Blood and liver samples were collected, enzyme activities and gene expression were analyzed in liver, lipid and fatty acid composition in liver and plasma, one-carbon metabolites, B-vitamin status, carnitine and acylcarnitines were analyzed in plasma. RESULTS: Liver mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation decreased by 40 % and steatosis was induced in a dose dependent manner; total lipids increased 1.6-fold in animals treated with 0.3 % TTP, 2-fold with 0.6 % TTP and 2.1 fold with 0.9 % TTP compared to control. The higher hepatic concentration of fatty acids was associated with shortening of carbon-length. Furthermore, the inhibited fatty acid oxidation led to a 30-fold decrease in plasma carnitine and 9.3-fold decrease in acetylcarnitine at the highest dose of TTP, whereas an accumulation of palmitoylcarnitine resulted. Compared to the control diet, TTP administration was associated with elevated plasma total Hcy (control: 7.2 ± 0.3 umol/L, 0.9 % TTP: 30.5 ± 5.9 umol/L) and 1.4-1.6 fold increase in the one-carbon metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine and glycine, accompanied by changes in gene expression of the different B-vitamin dependent pathways of Hcy and choline metabolism. A positive correlation between total Hcy and hepatic triacylglycerol resulted. CONCLUSIONS: The TTP-induced inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was not associated with increased hepatic oxidative stress or inflammation. Our data suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the methylation processes within the one-carbon metabolism in mice. PMCID: PMC4743328",

The higher hepatic concentration of fatty acids was associated with shortening of carbon-length. Furthermore, the inhibited fatty acid oxidation led to a 30-fold decrease in plasma carnitine and 9.3-fold decrease in acetylcarnitine at the highest dose of TTP, whereas an accumulation of palmitoylcarnitine resulted. Compared to the control diet, TTP administration was associated with elevated plasma total Hcy (control: 7.2 ± 0.3 umol/L, 0.9 % TTP: 30.5 ± 5.9 umol/L) and 1.4-1.6 fold increase in the one-carbon metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine and glycine, accompanied by changes in gene expression of the different B-vitamin dependent pathways of Hcy and choline metabolism. A positive correlation between total Hcy and hepatic triacylglycerol resulted. CONCLUSIONS: The TTP-induced inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was not associated with increased hepatic oxidative stress or inflammation. Our data suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the methylation processes within the one-carbon metabolism in mice. PMCID: PMC4743328",

BACKGROUND: Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methyl donor supplementation has been shown to alleviate NAFLD, connecting the condition to the one-carbon metabolism. Thus, the objective was to investigate regulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and metabolites along the choline oxidation pathway during induction of hepatic steatosis by the fatty acid analogue tetradecylthiopropionic acid (TTP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. METHODS: Mice were fed a control diet, or diets containing 0.3 %, 0.6 %, or 0.9 % (w/w) TTP for 14 days. Blood and liver samples were collected, enzyme activities and gene expression were analyzed in liver, lipid and fatty acid composition in liver and plasma, one-carbon metabolites, B-vitamin status, carnitine and acylcarnitines were analyzed in plasma. RESULTS: Liver mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation decreased by 40 % and steatosis was induced in a dose dependent manner; total lipids increased 1.6-fold in animals treated with 0.3 % TTP, 2-fold with 0.6 % TTP and 2.1 fold with 0.9 % TTP compared to control.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate how inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation using the compound tetradecylthiopropionic acid (TTP) would affect hepatic triacylglycerol level and plasma levels of kynurenine (Kyn) metabolites and nicotinamide. METHODS: 12 C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet, or an intervention diet supplemented with 0.9% (w/w) tetradecylthiopropionic acid for 14 days. Blood and liver samples were collected, enzyme activities and gene expression were analyzed in liver, in addition to fatty acid composition. Metabolites in the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway and total antioxidant status were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Dietary treatment with tetradecylthiopropionic acid for 2 weeks induced fatty liver accompanied by decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The liver content of the oxidized form of NAD+ was increased, as well as the ratio of NAD+/NADH, and these changes were associated by increased hepatic mRNA levels of NAD synthetase and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase-3. The downstream metabolites of kynurenine were reduced in plasma whereas the plasma nicotinamide content was increased. Some effects on inflammation and oxidative stress was observed in the liver, while the plasma antioxidant capacity was increased. This was accompanied by a reduced plasma ratio of kynurenine/tryptophan. In addition, a significant decrease in the inflammation-related arachidonic fatty acid in liver was observed. CONCLUSION: Fatty liver induced by short-time treatment with tetradecylthiopropionic acid decreased the levels of kynurenine metabolites but increased the plasma levels of NAD+ and nicotinamide. These changes are most likely not associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Most probably the increase of NAD+ and nicotinamide are generated through the Preiss Handler pathway and/or salvage pathway and not through the de novo pathway. The take home message is that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with the metabolic syndrome in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficiency. Inducing fatty liver in mice by inhibition of fatty acid oxidation resulted in a concomitant change in kynurenine metabolites increasing the plasma levels of nicotinamides and the hepatic NAD+/NADH ratio, probably without affecting the de novo pathway of kynurenines.

Lipin-1 performs dual function during lipid metabolism, i.e., it functions as a transcriptional coactivator and as a phosphatidate phosphatase during triglyceride biosynthesis. We investigated whether exendin-4 prevented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced hepatic steatosis and whether the protective effects of exendin-4 were associated with lipin-1 signaling. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin, ER stress inducers, increased triglycerides (TG) content and expression of genes encoding lipid droplet surface proteins. Exendin-4 decreased the expression of ER stress markers phosphorylated PKR like ER kinase (PERK), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) proteins and spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1s) mRNA and increased the expression of genes encoding lipolytic enzymes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and VLDL assembly-associated proteins microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) in tunicamycin-pretreated cells. Moreover, exendin-4 significantly decreased lipin-1β/α ratio by increasing SFRP10 and increased lipin-1 nuclear localization. The decrease in lipin-1β/α ratio was also observed in SIRT1 and AMPK agonist-treated cells. These data suggest that exendin-4 improves ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipolysis and VLDL assembly, which is partially mediated by the regulation of lipin-1 signaling.

Previously, TMX was considered a non-toxic neonicotinoid insecticide to mammals. However, the genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity of TMX in mammals were recently reported. Thus far, the effects of TMX on the mouse liver and its detailed mechanism remain unclear. NNMT, strongly expressed in the liver, plays a critical role in body energy expenditure. To confirm the potential pathogenesis of liver dysfunction induced by TMX, ICR mice were exposed to TMX at a dose of 4 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg by gavage administration for 12 weeks. The data showed that chronic TMX exposure caused dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. Moreover, aggravated oxidative stress, dysfunction, and disorganized structure were also observed in TMX-treated mouse livers. In addition, increases of PPARγ, fatty acid synthase, and NNMT expression, as well as decreases of PPARα and GNMT expression, S-adenosylmethionine deficiency, and methionine metabolism disorder were also observed in TMX-treated mouse livers. These results suggest that chronic TMX exposure induces dyslipidemia and NAFLD in mice. Moreover, inhibition of NNMT in hepatocytes significantly reversed the effects of TMX. The molecular mechanism of TMX-induced NAFLD is mostly through NNMT-mediated methionine metabolism and methyl donor balance, which ultimately regulates PPARα signaling pathway. Inhibition of NNMT could be a potentially novel strategy for blocking the progression of NAFLD induced by TMX.

Electronic address: guning@hit.edu.cn. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is one of the major compounds of neonicotinoids, the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide. Previously, TMX was considered a non-toxic neonicotinoid insecticide to mammals. However, the genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity of TMX in mammals were recently reported. Thus far, the effects of TMX on the mouse liver and its detailed mechanism remain unclear. NNMT, strongly expressed in the liver, plays a critical role in body energy expenditure. To confirm the potential pathogenesis of liver dysfunction induced by TMX, ICR mice were exposed to TMX at a dose of 4 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg by gavage administration for 12 weeks. The data showed that chronic TMX exposure caused dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. Moreover, aggravated oxidative stress, dysfunction, and disorganized structure were also observed in TMX-treated mouse livers. In addition, increases of PPARγ, fatty acid synthase, and NNMT expression, as well as decreases of PPARα and GNMT expression, S-adenosylmethionine deficiency, and methionine metabolism disorder were also observed in TMX-treated mouse livers. These results suggest that chronic TMX exposure induces dyslipidemia and NAFLD in mice. Moreover, inhibition of NNMT in hepatocytes significantly reversed the effects of TMX. The molecular mechanism of TMX-induced NAFLD is mostly through NNMT-mediated methionine metabolism and methyl donor balance, which ultimately regulates PPARα signaling pathway. Inhibition of NNMT could be a potentially novel strategy for blocking the progression of NAFLD induced by TMX.

Rats (n = 10 per group) were intraperitoneally injected with TAA (200 mg/kg bw) thrice a week for seven weeks in combination with a respective experimental diet. Rats in the TAA-treated group received either a chow diet (Control group) or a chow diet containing MS (TMS group, 2.05%) or silymarin (TSM group, 0.05%). Rats in the normal group were injected with PBS as a vehicle and received a chow diet. Rats in the TMS group showed significantly lower hepatic lipid concentrations than rats in the control group (p < 0.05). Hepatic protein expression levels of fatty acid synthase, SREBP-1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and SREBP-2 were significantly downregulated in the TMS group, whereas carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 levels were upregulated (p < 0.05). Hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were lower in the TMS group, whereas protein levels of glutathione peroxidase and catalase were elevated (p < 0.05). The effects of MS were comparable to those of silymarin. Our results evidently showed that MS inhibits hepatic lipid accumulation by suppressing lipid synthesis, accompanied by lipid oxidation and elevation of antioxidative status.

Grünig D(1)(2), (2), (2), (2)(3), Krähenbühl S(1)(2)(3). Author information: (1)Division of Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland. (2)Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland. (3)Swiss Center for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT), 4055 Basel, Switzerland. Tolcapone and entacapone are catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors used in patients with Parkinson's disease. For tolcapone, patients with liver failure have been reported with microvesicular steatosis observed in the liver biopsy of 1 patient. We therefore investigated the impact of tolcapone and entacapone on fatty acid metabolism in HepaRG cells exposed for 24 h and on acutely exposed mouse liver mitochondria. In HepaRG cells, tolcapone induced lipid accumulation starting at 100 µM, whereas entacapone was ineffective up to 200 µM. In HepaRG cells, tolcapone-inhibited palmitate metabolism and activation starting at 100 µM, whereas entacapone did not affect palmitate metabolism. In isolated mouse liver mitochondria, tolcapone inhibited palmitate metabolism starting at 5 µM and entacapone at 50 µM. Inhibition of palmitate activation could be confirmed by the acylcarnitine pattern in the supernatant of HepaRG cell cultures. Tolcapone-reduced mRNA and protein expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) and protein expression of ACSL5, whereas entacapone did not affect ACSL expression. Tolcapone increased mRNA expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36/FAT, impaired the secretion of ApoB100 by HepaRG cells and reduced the mRNA expression of ApoB100, but did not relevantly affect markers of fatty acid binding, lipid droplet formation and microsomal lipid transfer. In conclusion, tolcapone impaired hepatocellular fatty acid metabolism at lower concentrations than entacapone. Tolcapone increased mRNA expression of fatty acid transporters, inhibited activation of long-chain fatty acids and impaired very low-density lipoprotein secretion, causing hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation. The findings may be relevant in patients with a high tolcapone exposure and preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Author information: (1)Department of Basic Sciences, Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State, Mississippi. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed significant positive associations between exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides and occurrence of the metabolic syndrome and there are a growing number of animal-based studies to support causality. However, the cellular mechanisms linking OC compound exposure and metabolic dysfunction remain elusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if direct exposure to three highly implicated OC compounds promoted hepatic steatosis, the hepatic ramification of the metabolic syndrome. First, the steatotic effect of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor was determined in freshly isolated rat primary hepatocytes. Exposure to trans-nonachlor significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation as opposed to DDE and oxychlordane. To determine possible mechanisms governing increased fatty acid availability, the effects of trans-nonachlor exposure on fatty acid uptake, de novo lipogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and fatty acid oxidation were explored. Trans-nonachlor did not significantly alter fatty acid uptake. However, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis as well as basal expression of fatty acid synthase, a major regulator of lipogenesis were significantly increased following trans-nonachlor exposure. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in fatty acid oxidation following trans-nonachlor exposure. This decrease in fatty acid oxidation was accompanied by a slight, but significant increase in oleic acid-induced cellular triglyceride secretion. Therefore, taken together, the present data indicate direct exposure to trans-nonachlor has a more potent pro-steatotic effect than exposure to DDE or oxychlordane.

Author information: (1)Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China. (2)Department of Toxicology, Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan, Shandong, 250014, China. Tributyltin (TBT), a proven environmental obesogen, functions as a nanomolar agonist of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). However, the adverse effects of TBT on metabolism are incompletely understood. In this study, male ICR mice were administered TBT (5 and 50 μg·kg-1 ) by an intraperitoneal injection once every 3 days for 30 days from 28 days of age and bred for another 30 days after the last administration of TBT. We analyzed the effects of these exposures on the fat depot weights, serum lipid profile, serum leptin and adiponectin, hepatic lipid accumulation, and activity of AKT in the liver and skeletal muscle isolated from mice 8 mins after receiving an insulin injection. Pubertal exposure to TBTCl resulted in a higher body weight, increased epididymal and liver fat accumulation, hyperlipidemia, an elevated low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, serum adiponectin deficiency, worse glucose tolerance, and lower insulin-dependent AKT phosphorylation in the liver and muscle in mice. These results showed that TBT exposure induced peripheral insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in mice. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Electronic address: zwcai@hkbu.edu.hk. Previous in vivo exposure studies focused mainly on nuclear receptors involved in hepatotoxicity of triclosan (TCS). As liver plays a vital role in metabolic processes, dysregulations in lipid metabolism have been identified as potential drivers of pathogenesis. Investigation of changes in lipid metabolism might widen our understanding of toxicological effects as well as the underlying mechanism occurring in the liver. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the effect of TCS exposure on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice. Our results showed that TCS induced significant changes in hepatic free fatty acid pool by upregulation of fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis. Besides, hepatic levels of lipids, including acyl carnitine (AcCa), ceramide (Cer), triacylglycerols (TG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were also increased, together with upreguation of genes associated to TG synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and inflammation in TCS exposure group. These changes in lipid homeostasis could contribute to membrane instability, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Our results suggested that TCS exposure could induce hepatic lipid metabolism disorders in mice, which would further contribute to the liver damage effects of TCS.",

As liver plays a vital role in metabolic processes, dysregulations in lipid metabolism have been identified as potential drivers of pathogenesis. Investigation of changes in lipid metabolism might widen our understanding of toxicological effects as well as the underlying mechanism occurring in the liver. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the effect of TCS exposure on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice. Our results showed that TCS induced significant changes in hepatic free fatty acid pool by upregulation of fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis. Besides, hepatic levels of lipids, including acyl carnitine (AcCa), ceramide (Cer), triacylglycerols (TG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were also increased, together with upreguation of genes associated to TG synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and inflammation in TCS exposure group. These changes in lipid homeostasis could contribute to membrane instability, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Our results suggested that TCS exposure could induce hepatic lipid metabolism disorders in mice, which would further contribute to the liver damage effects of TCS.",

(2)Faculty of Science, RECETOX, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ62500, Brno, Czech Republic. Electronic address: ludek.blaha@recetox.muni.cz. A wide range of novel replacement flame retardants (nFRs) is consistently detected in increasing concentrations in the environment and human matrices. Evidence suggests that nFRs exposure may be associated with disruption of the endocrine system, which has been linked with the etiology of various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a multifactorial disease characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of fats (lipids) in the hepatocytes and involves multiple-hit pathogenesis, including exposure to occupational and environmental chemicals such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of the nFRs-induced hepatic steatosis in the human liver cells. In this study, we employed an in vitro bioassay toolbox to assess the key events (KEs) in the proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOP) (s) for hepatic steatosis. We examined nine nFRs using AOP- based in vitro assays measuring KEs such as lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, gene expression, and in silico approach to identify the putative molecular initiating events (MIEs). Our findings suggest that several tested OPFRs induced lipid accumulation in human liver cell culture. Tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) induced the highest lipid accumulation by altering the expression of genes encoding hepatic de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction depicted by decreased cellular ATP production. Available in vitro data from ToxCast and in silico molecular docking suggests that pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) could be the molecular targets for the tested nFRs. The study identifies several nFRs, such as TMPP and EHDPP, TPHP, and TDCIPP, as potential risk factor for NAFLD and advances our understanding of the mechanisms involved, demonstrating the utility of an AOP-based strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of toxicity.",

Tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) induced the highest lipid accumulation by altering the expression of genes encoding hepatic de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction depicted by decreased cellular ATP production. Available in vitro data from ToxCast and in silico molecular docking suggests that pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) could be the molecular targets for the tested nFRs. The study identifies several nFRs, such as TMPP and EHDPP, TPHP, and TDCIPP, as potential risk factor for NAFLD and advances our understanding of the mechanisms involved, demonstrating the utility of an AOP-based strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of toxicity.",

A wide range of novel replacement flame retardants (nFRs) is consistently detected in increasing concentrations in the environment and human matrices. Evidence suggests that nFRs exposure may be associated with disruption of the endocrine system, which has been linked with the etiology of various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Evidence suggests that nFRs exposure may be associated with disruption of the endocrine system, which has been linked with the etiology of various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a multifactorial disease characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of fats (lipids) in the hepatocytes and involves multiple-hit pathogenesis, including exposure to occupational and environmental chemicals such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of the nFRs-induced hepatic steatosis in the human liver cells. In this study, we employed an in vitro bioassay toolbox to assess the key events (KEs) in the proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOP) (s) for hepatic steatosis. We examined nine nFRs using AOP- based in vitro assays measuring KEs such as lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, gene expression, and in silico approach to identify the putative molecular initiating events (MIEs). Our findings suggest that several tested OPFRs induced lipid accumulation in human liver cell culture. Tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) induced the highest lipid accumulation by altering the expression of genes encoding hepatic de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction depicted by decreased cellular ATP production. Available in vitro data from ToxCast and in silico molecular docking suggests that pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) could be the molecular targets for the tested nFRs. The study identifies several nFRs, such as TMPP and EHDPP, TPHP, and TDCIPP, as potential risk factor for NAFLD and advances our understanding of the mechanisms involved, demonstrating the utility of an AOP-based strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of toxicity.",

    "text": "2021 Nov 15;289:117855. Epub 2021 Jul 28. An adverse outcome pathway based in vitro characterization of novel flame retardants-induced hepatic steatosis. Negi CK(1), . Author information: (1)Faculty of Science, RECETOX, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ62500, Brno, Czech Republic. (2)Faculty of Science, RECETOX, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, CZ62500, Brno, Czech Republic. Electronic address: ludek.blaha@recetox.muni.cz. A wide range of novel replacement flame retardants (nFRs) is consistently detected in increasing concentrations in the environment and human matrices. Evidence suggests that nFRs exposure may be associated with disruption of the endocrine system, which has been linked with the etiology of various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a multifactorial disease characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of fats (lipids) in the hepatocytes and involves multiple-hit pathogenesis, including exposure to occupational and environmental chemicals such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of the nFRs-induced hepatic steatosis in the human liver cells. In this study, we employed an in vitro bioassay toolbox to assess the key events (KEs) in the proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOP) (s) for hepatic steatosis. We examined nine nFRs using AOP- based in vitro assays measuring KEs such as lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, gene expression, and in silico approach to identify the putative molecular initiating events (MIEs). Our findings suggest that several tested OPFRs induced lipid accumulation in human liver cell culture. Tricresyl phosphate (TMPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) induced the highest lipid accumulation by altering the expression of genes encoding hepatic de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction depicted by decreased cellular ATP production. Available in vitro data from ToxCast and in silico molecular docking suggests that pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) could be the molecular targets for the tested nFRs. The study identifies several nFRs, such as TMPP and EHDPP, TPHP, and TDCIPP, as potential risk factor for NAFLD and advances our understanding of the mechanisms involved, demonstrating the utility of an AOP-based strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of toxicity.",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and associated protein aggregation are closely associated with human diseases, including alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. Inhibition of ER stress can have a significant effect on the prevention of hepatic dyslipidemia. Here, we studied the role of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, on ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. We studied ER stress induction following CCl4 exposure and delineated mechanisms of the CCl4-induced ER stress response in liver tissue from mice. CCl4 affected the formation of disulfide bonds through excessive hyper-oxidation of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Increased complex formation between PDI and its client proteins persisted in CCl4-exposed samples. Conversely, 4-PBA inhibited ER stress via secretion of apolipoprotein B and prevention of hepatic lipid accumulation. We also studied the mechanism-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and identified the ER stress-related proteins GRP78 and CHOP, along with plasma apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels, as novel biomarkers of ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. ER stress and its clinical relevance for therapeutic approaches were well correlated with the activity of the ER stress regulator 4-PBA, which may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of hepatic lipid accumulation, such as hepatic steatosis.",

Previous studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to hepatic steatosis in several manners.

The lipid metabolism disorder is the key role of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Selenoprotein P plays an important role in the pathological process of lipid accumulation. Coix lacryma-jboi seed oil (CLSO) is an active component extracted from Coix lacryma-jobi seed (CLS) which has been found to be effective of reducing blood fat and antioxidative. But the effect and mechanism of CLSO on NAFLD are not clear. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of CLSO in the treatment of NAFLD. Our result showed that CLSO decreased the liver/body weight ratio, lowered the total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerol (TG), and elevated the high density lipoprotein (HDL) in serum. CLSO reduced the lipid deposition in the liver of NAFLD rats. In addition, CLSO could bring down the abnormal expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, CLSO significantly declined the liver apolipoprotein E (apoE), apolipoprotein E receptor (apoER) and selenoprotein P 1 (SePP1) expression. In vivo, CLSO decreased the lipid droplets and TG level, reduced the protein expression of SePP1, apoER, phosphor-adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells induced by oleic acid and palmitic acid (OP). At the same time, lipid accumulation was observed in the Sepp1 high expression cells induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activator tunicamycin (Tm). CLSO could identically reduce the protein expression of SePP1, apoER, p-AMPK in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells induced by Tm. This result not only proved the CLSO had therapeutic effect on NAFLD, but also confirmed its mechanism associated with degrading the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which led to the decrease of the expression SePP1/apoER2 in order to reduce lipid accumulation. The study suggests CLSO has great medicinal value in treating NAFLD besides its edibility.",

Disorders of hepatic energy metabolism, which can be regulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lead to metabolic diseases such as hepatic steatosis and hypoglycemia. Tunicamycin, a pharmacological ER stress inducer, is used to develop an anti-cancer drug. However, the effects of tunicamycin on hepatic energy metabolism have not been well elucidated. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with tunicamycin or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, hepatic triglyceride and glycogen content and serum lipids profiles were analyzed, as well as the expression of lipogenic and gluconeogenic genes. Tunicamycin significantly induced hepatic a yellowish color and ER stress, as well as increasing serum levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Besides, tunicamycin remarkably increased hepatic triglyceride content and suppressed the expression of apolipoprotein B100. In addition, tunicamycin-treated mice had lower serum levels of triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α was decreased by tunicamycin, but the protein level was increased. Furthermore, blood glucose level and hepatic glycogen content were decreased in tunicamycin-treated mice. Protein kinase B signaling was attenuated in the tunicamycin-treated liver, but the expression and activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were unchanged. Tunicamycin alters hepatic energy homeostasis by increasing triglyceride accumulation and decreasing glycogen content.

Disorders of hepatic energy metabolism, which can be regulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lead to metabolic diseases such as hepatic steatosis and hypoglycemia. Tunicamycin, a pharmacological ER stress inducer, is used to develop an anti-cancer drug. However, the effects of tunicamycin on hepatic energy metabolism have not been well elucidated. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with tunicamycin or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, hepatic triglyceride and glycogen content and serum lipids profiles were analyzed, as well as the expression of lipogenic and gluconeogenic genes. Tunicamycin significantly induced hepatic a yellowish color and ER stress, as well as increasing serum levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Besides, tunicamycin remarkably increased hepatic triglyceride content and suppressed the expression of apolipoprotein B100. In addition, tunicamycin-treated mice had lower serum levels of triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α was decreased by tunicamycin, but the protein level was increased. Furthermore, blood glucose level and hepatic glycogen content were decreased in tunicamycin-treated mice. Protein kinase B signaling was attenuated in the tunicamycin-treated liver, but the expression and activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were unchanged. Tunicamycin alters hepatic energy homeostasis by increasing triglyceride accumulation and decreasing glycogen content.

Lipin-1 performs dual function during lipid metabolism, i.e., it functions as a transcriptional coactivator and as a phosphatidate phosphatase during triglyceride biosynthesis. We investigated whether exendin-4 prevented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced hepatic steatosis and whether the protective effects of exendin-4 were associated with lipin-1 signaling. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin, ER stress inducers, increased triglycerides (TG) content and expression of genes encoding lipid droplet surface proteins. Exendin-4 decreased the expression of ER stress markers phosphorylated PKR like ER kinase (PERK), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) proteins and spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1s) mRNA and increased the expression of genes encoding lipolytic enzymes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and VLDL assembly-associated proteins microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) in tunicamycin-pretreated cells. Moreover, exendin-4 significantly decreased lipin-1β/α ratio by increasing SFRP10 and increased lipin-1 nuclear localization. The decrease in lipin-1β/α ratio was also observed in SIRT1 and AMPK agonist-treated cells. These data suggest that exendin-4 improves ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipolysis and VLDL assembly, which is partially mediated by the regulation of lipin-1 signaling.

(2)Department of Nephrology, Hebei General Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050051, P.R. China. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing health threat that has previously been associated with lipogenesis. The direct effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibition on the induction of lipogenesis has not been investigated in hepatocytes in vitro. The impact of activating transcription factor‑4 (ATF4) on the lipogenic pathway and hepatic insulin transduction in liver cells also requires further investigation. In the present study, the triglyceride (TG) content of HepG2 cells stimulated with fructose was investigated using a commercially available enzymatic assay, and the expression levels of lipogenesis‑associated factors were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the TG content of HepG2 cells was increased following incubation with fructose, which was accompanied by ERS. 4‑Phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of ERS, lowered the TG content by reducing the mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element‑binding protein 1 (SREBP‑1c) and carbohydrate‑responsive element‑binding protein (ChREBP), and the protein expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl‑CoA desaturase‑1 (SCD‑1). Conversely, tunicamycin, which is an inducer of ERS, increased the TG content and stimulated the expression of the above lipogeneic markers. ATF4 deficiency relieved TG accumulation and decreased the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP, and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1 in fructose‑treated HepG2 cells. Conversely, ATF4 overexpression increased the TG content by upregulating the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1. Inhibition of ERS was shown to protect HepG2 cells against fructose‑induced TG accumulation, whereas induction of ERS stimulated hepatic lipogenesis. As a downstream transcription factor of the unfolded protein response, a deficiency in ATF4 attenuates fructose‑induced lipogenesis; while an overexpression of ATF4 can induce TG accumulation through stimulating hepatic lipogenesis. The results of the present study suggested that ATF4 may exert various physiological roles in lipid metabolism depending on the nutrient composition. In addition, these results suggested that ATF4 has a role in regulating lipogenesis and in the development of NAFLD; thus ATF4 may be considered a therapeutic target for NAFLD.",

In addition, these results suggested that ATF4 has a role in regulating lipogenesis and in the development of NAFLD; thus ATF4 may be considered a therapeutic target for NAFLD.",

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing health threat that has previously been associated with lipogenesis. The direct effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibition on the induction of lipogenesis has not been investigated in hepatocytes in vitro. The impact of activating transcription factor‑4 (ATF4) on the lipogenic pathway and hepatic insulin transduction in liver cells also requires further investigation. In the present study, the triglyceride (TG) content of HepG2 cells stimulated with fructose was investigated using a commercially available enzymatic assay, and the expression levels of lipogenesis‑associated factors were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the TG content of HepG2 cells was increased following incubation with fructose, which was accompanied by ERS. 4‑Phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of ERS, lowered the TG content by reducing the mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element‑binding protein 1 (SREBP‑1c) and carbohydrate‑responsive element‑binding protein (ChREBP), and the protein expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl‑CoA desaturase‑1 (SCD‑1). Conversely, tunicamycin, which is an inducer of ERS, increased the TG content and stimulated the expression of the above lipogeneic markers. ATF4 deficiency relieved TG accumulation and decreased the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP, and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1 in fructose‑treated HepG2 cells. Conversely, ATF4 overexpression increased the TG content by upregulating the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1. Inhibition of ERS was shown to protect HepG2 cells against fructose‑induced TG accumulation, whereas induction of ERS stimulated hepatic lipogenesis.

As a downstream transcription factor of the unfolded protein response, a deficiency in ATF4 attenuates fructose‑induced lipogenesis; while an overexpression of ATF4 can induce TG accumulation through stimulating hepatic lipogenesis. The results of the present study suggested that ATF4 may exert various physiological roles in lipid metabolism depending on the nutrient composition. In addition, these results suggested that ATF4 has a role in regulating lipogenesis and in the development of NAFLD; thus ATF4 may be considered a therapeutic target for NAFLD.",

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing health threat that has previously been associated with lipogenesis. The direct effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibition on the induction of lipogenesis has not been investigated in hepatocytes in vitro. The impact of activating transcription factor‑4 (ATF4) on the lipogenic pathway and hepatic insulin transduction in liver cells also requires further investigation. In the present study, the triglyceride (TG) content of HepG2 cells stimulated with fructose was investigated using a commercially available enzymatic assay, and the expression levels of lipogenesis‑associated factors were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the TG content of HepG2 cells was increased following incubation with fructose, which was accompanied by ERS. 4‑Phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of ERS, lowered the TG content by reducing the mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element‑binding protein 1 (SREBP‑1c) and carbohydrate‑responsive element‑binding protein (ChREBP), and the protein expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl‑CoA desaturase‑1 (SCD‑1). Conversely, tunicamycin, which is an inducer of ERS, increased the TG content and stimulated the expression of the above lipogeneic markers. ATF4 deficiency relieved TG accumulation and decreased the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP, and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1 in fructose‑treated HepG2 cells.

Conversely, ATF4 overexpression increased the TG content by upregulating the mRNA expression levels of SREBP‑1c and ChREBP and protein expression levels of FAS, ACC and SCD‑1. Inhibition of ERS was shown to protect HepG2 cells against fructose‑induced TG accumulation, whereas induction of ERS stimulated hepatic lipogenesis. As a downstream transcription factor of the unfolded protein response, a deficiency in ATF4 attenuates fructose‑induced lipogenesis; while an overexpression of ATF4 can induce TG accumulation through stimulating hepatic lipogenesis. The results of the present study suggested that ATF4 may exert various physiological roles in lipid metabolism depending on the nutrient composition. In addition, these results suggested that ATF4 has a role in regulating lipogenesis and in the development of NAFLD; thus ATF4 may be considered a therapeutic target for NAFLD.",

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing health threat that has previously been associated with lipogenesis. The direct effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibition on the induction of lipogenesis has not been investigated in hepatocytes in vitro. The impact of activating transcription factor‑4 (ATF4) on the lipogenic pathway and hepatic insulin transduction in liver cells also requires further investigation. In the present study, the triglyceride (TG) content of HepG2 cells stimulated with fructose was investigated using a commercially available enzymatic assay, and the expression levels of lipogenesis‑associated factors were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the TG content of HepG2 cells was increased following incubation with fructose, which was accompanied by ERS. 4‑Phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of ERS, lowered the TG content by reducing the mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element‑binding protein 1 (SREBP‑1c) and carbohydrate‑responsive element‑binding protein (ChREBP), and the protein expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl‑CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl‑CoA desaturase‑1 (SCD‑1).

Prolonged ER stress has been known to be one of the major drivers of impaired lipid homeostasis during the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). However, the downstream mediators of ER stress pathway in promoting lipid accumulation remain poorly understood. Here, we present data showing the b-ZIP transcription factor E4BP4 in both the hepatocytes and the mouse liver is potently induced by the chemical ER stress inducer tunicamycin or by high-fat, low-methionine, and choline-deficient (HFLMCD) diet. We showed that such an induction is partially dependent on CHOP, a known mediator of ER stress and requires the E-box element of the E4bp4 promoter. Tunicamycin promotes the lipid droplet formation and alters lipid metabolic gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes from E4bp4flox/flox but not E4bp4 liver-specific KO (E4bp4-LKO) mice. Compared with E4bp4flox/flox mice, E4bp4-LKO female mice exhibit reduced liver lipid accumulation and partially improved liver function after 10-week HFLMCD diet feeding. Mechanistically, we observed elevated AMPK activity and the AMPKβ1 abundance in the liver of E4bp4-LKO mice. We have evidence supporting that E4BP4 may suppress the AMPK activity via promoting the AMPKβ1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, acute depletion of the Ampkβ1 subunit restores lipid droplet formation in E4bp4-LKO primary mouse hepatocytes.

Prolonged ER stress has been known to be one of the major drivers of impaired lipid homeostasis during the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). However, the downstream mediators of ER stress pathway in promoting lipid accumulation remain poorly understood. Here, we present data showing the b-ZIP transcription factor E4BP4 in both the hepatocytes and the mouse liver is potently induced by the chemical ER stress inducer tunicamycin or by high-fat, low-methionine, and choline-deficient (HFLMCD) diet. We showed that such an induction is partially dependent on CHOP, a known mediator of ER stress and requires the E-box element of the E4bp4 promoter. Tunicamycin promotes the lipid droplet formation and alters lipid metabolic gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes from E4bp4flox/flox but not E4bp4 liver-specific KO (E4bp4-LKO) mice. Compared with E4bp4flox/flox mice, E4bp4-LKO female mice exhibit reduced liver lipid accumulation and partially improved liver function after 10-week HFLMCD diet feeding. Mechanistically, we observed elevated AMPK activity and the AMPKβ1 abundance in the liver of E4bp4-LKO mice. We have evidence supporting that E4BP4 may suppress the AMPK activity via promoting the AMPKβ1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, acute depletion of the Ampkβ1 subunit restores lipid droplet formation in E4bp4-LKO primary mouse hepatocytes. Our study highlighted hepatic E4BP4 as a key factor linking ER stress and lipid accumulation in the liver. Targeting E4BP4 in the liver may be a novel therapeutic avenue for treating NAFLD. © 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. PMCID: PMC8011030",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is highly associated with liver steatosis. B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to be involved in ER homeostasis, and plays key roles in hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. However, whether BAP31 modulates hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating ER stress is still uncertain. In this study, wild-type and liver-specific BAP31-depleted mice were administrated with ER stress activator of Tunicamycin, the markers of ER stress, liver steatosis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were determined. BAP31 deficiency increased Tunicamycin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, aggravated liver dysfunction, and increased the mRNA levels of ER stress markers, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), inositol-requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), thus promoting ER stress in vivo and in vitro. Hepatic lipid export via very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was impaired in BAP31-depleted mice, accompanied by reduced Apolipoprotein B (APOB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression. Exogenous lipid clearance was also inhibited, along with impaired gene expression related to fatty acid transportation and fatty acid β-oxidation. Finally, BAP31 deficiency increased Tunicamycin-induced hepatic inflammatory response. These results demonstrate that BAP31 deficiency increased Tunicamycin-induced ER stress, impaired VLDL secretion and exogenous lipid clearance, and reduced fatty acid β-oxidation, which eventually resulted in liver steatosis.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is highly associated with liver steatosis. B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been reported to be involved in ER homeostasis, and plays key roles in hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. However, whether BAP31 modulates hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating ER stress is still uncertain. In this study, wild-type and liver-specific BAP31-depleted mice were administrated with ER stress activator of Tunicamycin, the markers of ER stress, liver steatosis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were determined. BAP31 deficiency increased Tunicamycin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, aggravated liver dysfunction, and increased the mRNA levels of ER stress markers, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), inositol-requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), thus promoting ER stress in vivo and in vitro. Hepatic lipid export via very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion was impaired in BAP31-depleted mice, accompanied by reduced Apolipoprotein B (APOB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression. Exogenous lipid clearance was also inhibited, along with impaired gene expression related to fatty acid transportation and fatty acid β-oxidation.

Wang Q(1), . Author information: (1)Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Ministry of Education, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130062, China. (2)Department of Paediatric Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, China. The activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is closely related to the alleviation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by regulating oxidative stress and lipid homeostasis. Gentiopicroside (GPS), an iridoid glycoside found in the Gentianaceae, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, the protective effects of GPS on lipid accumulation and oxidative damage have not been investigated thoroughly in free fatty acid- (FFA-) induced HepG2 cells and tyloxapol- (Ty-) induced hyperlipidemia mice. Cell counting kit-8 assays, Oil Red O staining, Western blotting analysis, extraction of nuclear and cytosolic proteins, and biochemical index assay were employed to explore the mechanisms by which GPS exerts a protective effect on FFA-induced HepG2 cells and Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. This paper demonstrates that GPS could effectively alleviate NAFLD by elevating cell viability, reducing fatty deposition, downregulating TG, and activating nucleus Nrf2 in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, GPS significantly regulated the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and GPS-inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression in FFA-stimulated lipid accumulation of HepG2 cells and Ty-treated mice. Interestingly, we highlight that PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) markedly increased the expression of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, PPARα, and downregulated SREBP-1c in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells. For these reasons, we found that the deletion of Nrf2 could lose the protective effects of GPS on the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and PPARα activation and SREBP-1c inactivation in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells and Ty-treated mice. GPS treatment had no effect on abnormal lipogenesis and antioxidant enzymes in Ty-induced Nrf2-/- mice. This work gives a new explanation that GPS may be a useful therapeutic strategy for NAFLD through upregulation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, which can alleviate oxidative damage and lipid accumulation.

Cell counting kit-8 assays, Oil Red O staining, Western blotting analysis, extraction of nuclear and cytosolic proteins, and biochemical index assay were employed to explore the mechanisms by which GPS exerts a protective effect on FFA-induced HepG2 cells and Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. This paper demonstrates that GPS could effectively alleviate NAFLD by elevating cell viability, reducing fatty deposition, downregulating TG, and activating nucleus Nrf2 in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, GPS significantly regulated the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and GPS-inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression in FFA-stimulated lipid accumulation of HepG2 cells and Ty-treated mice. Interestingly, we highlight that PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) markedly increased the expression of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, PPARα, and downregulated SREBP-1c in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells. For these reasons, we found that the deletion of Nrf2 could lose the protective effects of GPS on the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and PPARα activation and SREBP-1c inactivation in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells and Ty-treated mice. GPS treatment had no effect on abnormal lipogenesis and antioxidant enzymes in Ty-induced Nrf2-/- mice. This work gives a new explanation that GPS may be a useful therapeutic strategy for NAFLD through upregulation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, which can alleviate oxidative damage and lipid accumulation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hyperuricemia significantly increases risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are as yet unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of uric acid on development of NAFLD and insulin resistance. METHODS: We initially analyzed the impact of uric acid on the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice and in two cell models, HepG2 and L02. Subsequently, we studied the role of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in uric acid-induced fat accumulation and insulin signaling impairment. RESULTS: We found that uric acid directly induces hepatocyte fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and insulin signaling impairment both in vivo and in vitro. We also found that uric acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas lowering uric acid by allopurinol inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a high fat diet mouse model of NAFLD. Moreover, knocking down NLRP3 expression significantly attenuated uric acid-induced fat accumulation both in HepG2 cells and L02 cells. Knocking down NLRP3 expression also rescued uric acid-induced insulin signaling impairment in both cell types.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hyperuricemia significantly increases risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are as yet unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of uric acid on development of NAFLD and insulin resistance. METHODS: We initially analyzed the impact of uric acid on the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice and in two cell models, HepG2 and L02. Subsequently, we studied the role of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in uric acid-induced fat accumulation and insulin signaling impairment. RESULTS: We found that uric acid directly induces hepatocyte fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and insulin signaling impairment both in vivo and in vitro. We also found that uric acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereas lowering uric acid by allopurinol inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a high fat diet mouse model of NAFLD. Moreover, knocking down NLRP3 expression significantly attenuated uric acid-induced fat accumulation both in HepG2 cells and L02 cells. Knocking down NLRP3 expression also rescued uric acid-induced insulin signaling impairment in both cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Uric acid regulates hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance through the NLRP3 inflammasome. Uric acid may be a new therapeutic target for NAFLD and insulin resistance. Elsevier B.V.

Background and Aims: Drug-induced steatosis is a major reason for drug failure in clinical trials and post-marketing withdrawal; and therefore, predictive biomarkers are essential. These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to fatty liver. However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis. Methods: Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls. Results: We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., irbesartan, fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade. Conclusion: Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis. PMCID: PMC5263149",

However, adverse effect like hepatic steatosis has been reported in patients receiving VPA treatment. But whether nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) are involved in the regulation of VPA-induced steatosis or not is still unknown. In this study, the roles of PXR and FABP4 in VPA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells were investigated. We found that the expression of PXR and FABP4 were increased by VPA in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of PXR not only reduced lipid accumulation but also impaired the induction of FABP4 by VPA. While overexpression of PXR enhanced both lipid accumulation and FABP4 expression. Moreover, exogenous expression of FABP4 increased triglyceride levels and enhanced lipid accumulation caused by VPA. Taken together, these results suggest that PXR-mediated expression of FABP4 is responsible for lipid accumulation caused by VPA.

Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, which may cause steatosis in the liver. Oxidative stress is associated with the progression of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis. However, the potential mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of CYP2E1-ROS-CD36/DGAT2 axis in the pathogenesis of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. First, VPA treatment (500 mg/kg in mice, 5 mM in LO2 cells) induced hepatic steatosis and enhanced reactive oxidative stress (ROS) level, and ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 200 mg/kg in mice, 1 mM in LO2 cells) reversed the changes. Next, we observed the enhanced expression and enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in VPA-treated mice and LO2 cells. Importantly, VPA-induced ROS accumulation and hepatic steatosis were attenuated when CYP2E1 was inhibited using CYP2E1 inhibitor, diallyl sulfide (DAS, 100 mg/kg in mice, 1 mM in LO2 cells) or in CYP2E1-knockdown cell line, suggesting that CYP2E1 plays a potential role in ROS production following hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA levels of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a fatty acid translocase protein and distinct diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were significantly upregulated in mice and LO2 cells after VPA treatment, while the change was alleviated by NAC and DAS. Meanwhile, time course experiments demonstrated that the increase of CYP2E1 level occurred earlier than that of ROS, CD36 and DGAT2, and ROS generation preceded the onset of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, VPA treatment enhances the expression and enzymatic activity of CYP2E1, which promotes ROS production and then causes CD36 and DGAT2 overproduction and hepatic steatosis in mice and LO2 cells, which provides a novel insight into VPA-induced hepatic steatosis.",

Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, which may cause steatosis in the liver. Oxidative stress is associated with the progression of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis. However, the potential mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of CYP2E1-ROS-CD36/DGAT2 axis in the pathogenesis of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. First, VPA treatment (500 mg/kg in mice, 5 mM in LO2 cells) induced hepatic steatosis and enhanced reactive oxidative stress (ROS) level, and ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 200 mg/kg in mice, 1 mM in LO2 cells) reversed the changes. Next, we observed the enhanced expression and enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in VPA-treated mice and LO2 cells. Importantly, VPA-induced ROS accumulation and hepatic steatosis were attenuated when CYP2E1 was inhibited using CYP2E1 inhibitor, diallyl sulfide (DAS, 100 mg/kg in mice, 1 mM in LO2 cells) or in CYP2E1-knockdown cell line, suggesting that CYP2E1 plays a potential role in ROS production following hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA levels of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a fatty acid translocase protein and distinct diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were significantly upregulated in mice and LO2 cells after VPA treatment, while the change was alleviated by NAC and DAS. Meanwhile, time course experiments demonstrated that the increase of CYP2E1 level occurred earlier than that of ROS, CD36 and DGAT2, and ROS generation preceded the onset of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, VPA treatment enhances the expression and enzymatic activity of CYP2E1, which promotes ROS production and then causes CD36 and DGAT2 overproduction and hepatic steatosis in mice and LO2 cells, which provides a novel insight into VPA-induced hepatic steatosis.",

Electronic address: Stephan.kraehenbuehl@usb.ch. Treatment with valproate is associated with hepatic steatosis, but the mechanisms are not fully elucidated in human cell systems. We therefore investigated the effects of valproate on fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line. In previously fatty acid loaded HepaRG cells, valproate impaired lipid droplet disposal starting at 1 mM after incubation for 3 or 7 days. Valproate increased the expression of genes associated with fatty acid import and triglyceride synthesis, but did not relevantly affect expression of genes engaged in fatty acid activation. Valproate impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism by inhibiting β-ketothiolase and the function of the electron transport chain, which was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Valproate increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number per HepaRG cell, possibly as a consequence of impaired mitochondrial function. Valproate decreased the hepatocellular mRNA and protein expression of the fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) at 1 mM and increased the hepatocellular concentration of free fatty acids. Furthermore, valproate decreased protein expression and excretion of ApoB100 in HepaRG cells at 1 mM, reflecting impaired formation and excretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). In conclusion, valproate increased the hepatocellular triglyceride content by multiple mechanisms, whereby impaired expression of FABP1 and MTTP as well as impaired VLDL formation and excretion appeared to be dominant. Valproate caused cell death mainly by apoptosis, which may be a consequence of mitochondrial oxidative stress and increased hepatocellular concentration of free fatty acids.

We therefore investigated the effects of valproate on fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line. In previously fatty acid loaded HepaRG cells, valproate impaired lipid droplet disposal starting at 1 mM after incubation for 3 or 7 days. Valproate increased the expression of genes associated with fatty acid import and triglyceride synthesis, but did not relevantly affect expression of genes engaged in fatty acid activation. Valproate impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism by inhibiting β-ketothiolase and the function of the electron transport chain, which was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Valproate increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number per HepaRG cell, possibly as a consequence of impaired mitochondrial function. Valproate decreased the hepatocellular mRNA and protein expression of the fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) at 1 mM and increased the hepatocellular concentration of free fatty acids.

In the development of drugs, we sometimes encounter fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) which is not accompanied by degenerative change in the liver in non-clinical toxicity studies. In this study, we investigated the relationships between fatty change of the hepatocytes noted in non-clinical toxicity studies of compound X, a candidate compound in drug development, and mitochondrial dysfunction in order to estimate the potential risk of the compound to induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in humans. We conducted in vivo and in vitro exploratory studies for this purpose. In vivo lipidomics analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between alteration of the hepatic lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver of rats treated with compound X, triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids, which are the main energy source of the mitochondria, accumulated. Accumulation of these triglycerides was considered to be related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration based on the results of in vitro mitochondria toxicity studies. In conclusion, fatty change of the hepatocytes (steatosis) in non-clinical toxicity studies of drug candidates can be regarded as a critical finding for the estimation of their potential risk to induce DILI in humans when the fatty change is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Author information: (1)Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. (2)Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. t.vandenbeucken@maastrichtuniversity.nl. Valproic acid (VPA) is a frequently prescribed anti-epileptic drug which is known to cause liver toxicity and steatosis through mitochondrial dysfunction. Nevertheless the mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are incompletely understood. In this study, we determined the effect of relatively short (3 h) or prolonged (72 h) exposure to VPA on mitochondrial function in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). While 3 h VPA exposure did not affect oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in PHHs, prolonged exposure (24-72 h) significantly reduced basal and maximal OCRs. Given that in particular prolonged VPA exposure is required to cause mitochondrial dysfunction, we investigated gene expression data after VPA exposure for 24, 48, 72 h and 72 h VPA followed by a 72 h washout period. We were able to reduce the comprehensive gene expression changes into a more comprehensible set of 18 TFs that were predicted to be persistently activated after 72 h of VPA exposure. Lentiviral knock-down of one of the candidate TFs, C/EBPα, partly rescued VPA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis of shC/EBPα and shGFP control PHHs identified 24 genuine C/EBPα target genes that are regulated in response to prolonged VPA exposure in PHHs. Altogether this provides new insights on the involvement of C/EBPα in driving VPA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human liver cells. This hub gene, with its downstream regulators involved in this deregulation, thus represent potential new biomarkers for VPA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the most widely used antiepilepsy drugs. However, several side effects, including weight gain and fatty liver, have been reported in patients following VPA treatment. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis using FL83B cell line-based in vitro model. Using fluorescent lipid staining technique, we found that VPA enhanced oleic acid- (OLA-) induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in hepatocytes; this may be due to upregulated lipid uptake, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and lipid droplet formation. Real-time PCR results showed that, following VPA treatment, the expression levels of genes encoding cluster of differentiation 36 (Cd36), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), and perilipin 2 (Plin2) were increased, that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I a (Cpt1a) was not affected, and those of acetyl-Co A carboxylase α (Acca) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) were decreased. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analyses, we found that VPA also induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) nuclear translocation and increased levels of cell-surface CD36. Based on these results, we propose that VPA may enhance OLA-induced hepatocyte steatosis through the upregulation of PPARγ- and CD36-dependent lipid uptake, TAG synthesis, and lipid droplet formation.

Using fluorescent lipid staining technique, we found that VPA enhanced oleic acid- (OLA-) induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in hepatocytes; this may be due to upregulated lipid uptake, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and lipid droplet formation. Real-time PCR results showed that, following VPA treatment, the expression levels of genes encoding cluster of differentiation 36 (Cd36), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), and perilipin 2 (Plin2) were increased, that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I a (Cpt1a) was not affected, and those of acetyl-Co A carboxylase α (Acca) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) were decreased. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analyses, we found that VPA also induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) nuclear translocation and increased levels of cell-surface CD36. Based on these results, we propose that VPA may enhance OLA-induced hepatocyte steatosis through the upregulation of PPARγ- and CD36-dependent lipid uptake, TAG synthesis, and lipid droplet formation.

Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drugs, as VPA-induced hepatotoxicity is one of the most severe adverse reaction that can lead to death. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of dysregulated lipid metabolism in mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Nontargeted lipidomics analysis with liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS) was performed to explore differential lipids from the patient serum and L02 cells. Lipidomics data interpretation was augmented by gene expression analyses for the key enzymes in lipid metabolism pathways. From patient serum lipidomics, pronouncedly changed lipid species between abnormal liver function (ALF) patients and normal liver function (NLF) patients were identified. Among these lipid species, LPCs, Cers, and SMs were markedly reduced in the ALF group and showed negative relationships with liver injury severity [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels], while significantly increased triacylglycerols (TAG) with higher summed carbon numbers demonstrated a positive relationship with ALT levels. Regarding lipidomics in hepatic L02 cells, TAG was markedly elevated after VPA exposure, especially in TAGs with more than 53 summed carbons. Besides, gene expression analysis revealed dysregulated lipid metabolism in VPA-treated L02 cells. Peroxime proliferators-activated receptor (PPARγ) pathway played an important role in VPA-induced lipid disruption through inducing long-chain fatty acid uptake and TAG synthesis, which was also regulated by Akt pathway. Our findings present that VPA-induced lipid metabolism disruption might lead to lipotoxicity in the liver. This approach is expected to be applicable for other drug-induced toxicity assessments.

Nontargeted lipidomics analysis with liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS) was performed to explore differential lipids from the patient serum and L02 cells. Lipidomics data interpretation was augmented by gene expression analyses for the key enzymes in lipid metabolism pathways. From patient serum lipidomics, pronouncedly changed lipid species between abnormal liver function (ALF) patients and normal liver function (NLF) patients were identified. Among these lipid species, LPCs, Cers, and SMs were markedly reduced in the ALF group and showed negative relationships with liver injury severity [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels], while significantly increased triacylglycerols (TAG) with higher summed carbon numbers demonstrated a positive relationship with ALT levels. Regarding lipidomics in hepatic L02 cells, TAG was markedly elevated after VPA exposure, especially in TAGs with more than 53 summed carbons. Besides, gene expression analysis revealed dysregulated lipid metabolism in VPA-treated L02 cells. Peroxime proliferators-activated receptor (PPARγ) pathway played an important role in VPA-induced lipid disruption through inducing long-chain fatty acid uptake and TAG synthesis, which was also regulated by Akt pathway. Our findings present that VPA-induced lipid metabolism disruption might lead to lipotoxicity in the liver. This approach is expected to be applicable for other drug-induced toxicity assessments.

Mice were exposed to low VC concentrations (<1 ppm), or room air for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks, while on HFD or low-fat control diet (LFD). Some mice received Alda-1 (20 mg/kg i.p., 3 × /week) for the last 3 weeks of diet/VC exposure. Indices of liver injury, oxidative stress, metabolic and mitochondrial (dys)function were measured. As observed previously, low-dose VC did not cause liver injury in control mice; while liver injury caused by HFD was enhanced by VC. VC decreased hepatic ALDH2 activity of mice fed HFD. Alda-1 attenuated oxidative stress, liver injury, and dysmetabolism in mice exposed to HFD+VC under these conditions. Importantly, alterations in mitochondrial function caused by VC and HFD were diminished by Alda-1. Previous studies have indicated that liver injury caused by HFD is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Here, Alda-1 suppressed PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that ALDH2 is a critical defense against mitochondrial injury caused by VC in experimental NAFLD.

Vitamin D deficiency impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increases insulin resistance by reducing PPAR-γ expression in nonobese Type 2 diabetic rats. Kim DS(2), .

(2)Dept. of Food & Nutrition, Obesity/Diabetes Research Institutes, College of Natural Science, Hoseo University, Asan, Korea. Human studies have provided relatively strong associations of poor vitamin D status with Type 2 diabetes but do not explain the nature of the association. Here, we explored the physiological pathways that may explain how vitamin D status modulates energy, lipid and glucose metabolisms in nonobese Type 2 diabetic rats. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were fed high-fat diets containing 25 (VD-low), 1000 (VD-normal) or 10,000 (VD-high) cholecalciferol-IU/kg diet for 8 weeks. Energy expenditure, insulin resistance, insulin secretory capacity and lipid metabolism were measured. Serum 25-OH-D levels, an index of vitamin D status, increased dose dependently with dietary vitamin D. VD-low resulted in less fat oxidation without a significant difference in energy expenditure and less lean body mass in the abdomen and legs comparison to the VD-normal group. In comparison to VD-low, VD-normal had lower serum triglycerides and intracellular fat accumulation in the liver and skeletal muscles which was associated with down-regulation of the mRNA expressions of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthase and up-regulation of gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. In euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body and hepatic insulin resistance was exacerbated in the VD-low group but not in the VD-normal group, possibly through decreasing hepatic insulin signaling and PPAR-γ expression in the adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes 1,25-(OH)2-D (10 nM) increased triglyceride accumulation by elevating PPAR-γ expression and treatment with a PPAR-γ antagonist blocked the triglyceride deposition induced by 1,25-(OH)2-D treatment. VD-low impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in hyperglycemic clamp and decreased β-cell mass by decreasing β-cell proliferation. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency resulted in the dysregulation of glucose metabolism in GK rats by simultaneously increasing insulin resistance by decreasing adipose PPAR-γ expression and deteriorating β-cell function and mass.",

Hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression is increased in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and is required for liver steatosis in an NAFL mouse model. However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or lithocholic acid. The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-lithocholic acid, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.

Hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression is increased in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and is required for liver steatosis in an NAFL mouse model. However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or lithocholic acid. The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-lithocholic acid, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.

Testing drugs for interference with hepatic fatty acid metabolism is therefore important. To find out whether HepG2 cells are suitable for this purpose, we investigated the effect of three established fatty acid metabolism inhibitors and of three test compounds on triglyceride accumulation, palmitate metabolism, the acylcarnitine pool and dicarboxylic acid accumulation in the cell supernatant and on ApoB-100 excretion in HepG2 cells. The three established inhibitors [etomoxir, methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA), and 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA)] depleted mitochondrial ATP at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. They inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or lower concentrations than ATP depletion, and 4-BCA was associated with cellular fat accumulation. They caused specific changes in the acylcarnitine pattern and etomoxir an increase of thapsic (C18 dicarboxylic) acid in the cell supernatant, and did not interfere with ApoB-100 excretion (marker of VLDL export). The three test compounds (amiodarone, tamoxifen, and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2) depleted the cellular ATP content at lower concentrations than cytotoxicity occurred. They all caused cellular fat accumulation and inhibited palmitate metabolism at similar or higher concentrations than ATP depletion. They suppressed medium-chain acylcarnitines in the cell supernatant and amiodarone and tamoxifen impaired thapsic acid production. Tamoxifen and WIN 55,212-2 decreased cellular ApoB-100 excretion. In conclusion, the established inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism caused the expected effects in HepG2 cells. HepG cells proved to be useful for the detection of drug-associated toxicities on hepatocellular fatty acid metabolism. PMCID: PMC5924803",
