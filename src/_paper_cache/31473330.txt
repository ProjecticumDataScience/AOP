The aim of this study was to explore the role of E2 in the hepatic lipid metabolism of hybrid tilapia. The hybrid tilapias were injected with different concentrations of E2 (0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) (35 mg/kg) (an E2 receptor antagonist). Subsequently, the liver lipid depositions were analyzed by tissue sections with oil red O staining. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were assayed from the fish in different groups. Genes related to very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly, lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptors, fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol metabolism were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that 50 mg/kg E2 injections enlarged the lipid droplets significantly. Simultaneously, the E2 injections tended to upregulate TC, TG, LDL, and HDL in the serum. The 50 mg/kg E2 group showed a significantly higher expression of the VLDL assembly genes but depressed levels of LDLR and LRP1. In addition, FABP3, FABP11a and DGAT2 were significantly elevated, while CD36 and ACO1 decreased in the 50 mg/kg E2 injection. The ICI injection inhibited the expression of MTP, LPL, LRP1, CD36, FABP11a, ACO1 and FAS in tilapia livers. These results demonstrated that by stimulating the expression of genes associated with the VLDL assembly, inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptor-related genes and promoting the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the TG, E2 induced deposition of lipids in the livers of hybrid tilapia. Overall, the results suggest a role for E2 in fish lipid metabolisms that provide new clues to illustrate the sex steroid function in energy metabolism in livers. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
