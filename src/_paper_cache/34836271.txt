Genistein (GEN) has been shown to significantly inhibit hepatic triglyceride accretion triggered by estrogen deficiency. The main purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism induced by GEN. Different doses of GEN or GEN with an ERβ antagonist were treated with HepG2 cells. Results showed that 25 μM GEN significantly diminished triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, GEN downregulated the levels of genes and proteins involved in lipogenesis, such as sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and upregulated the gene and protein levels of the regulation factors responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT-1α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Furthermore, 25 μM GEN reduced the levels of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Moreover, most of these effects from GEN were reverted by pretreatment with the antagonist of ERβ. In conclusion, GEN improved hepatic lipid metabolism by activating ERβ and further modulation of Akt/mTOR signals. The results provide novel aspects of the regulatory mechanism of ERβ on hepatic lipid metabolism and might help to profoundly understand the functions of food-derived phytoestrogens in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women.
