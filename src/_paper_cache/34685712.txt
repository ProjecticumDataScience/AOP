Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is characterized by accumulation of hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and liver injury. The present study aimed to investigate if mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a role in FFA-induced organelle dysfunction, thereby contributing to the development of ALD. Cell studies were conducted to define the causal role and underlying mechanism of FFA-activated mTORC1 signaling in hepatocellular cell injury. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were subjected to chronic alcohol feeding with or without rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 activation. We revealed that palmitic acid (PA)-induced ER stress and suppression of LAMP2 and autophagy flux were mTORC1-dependent as rapamycin reversed such deleterious effects. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was downstream of ATF4 which partially modulated LAMP2. Supplementation with rapamycin to alcohol-fed mice attenuated mTORC1 activation and ER stress, restored LAMP2 protein, and improved autophagy, leading to amelioration of alcohol-induced liver injury. Induction of mTORC1 signaling and CHOP were also detected in the liver of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. This study demonstrates that hepatic FFAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALD by activating mTORC1 signaling, thereby inducing ER stress and suppressing LAMP2-autophagy flux pathway, which represents an important mechanism of FFA-induced hepatocellular injury.
