Tebuconazole (TEB), a triazole fungicide, is frequently applied to agriculture for the increase of food production. Although TEB causes liver toxicity, its effects on cellular lipid accumulation are rarely investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects of TEB on lipid metabolism and accumulation in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were exposed to 0-320 µM TEB for 1-24 h. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h)-treated cells showed lipid accumulation. Further, TEB (20-80 µM, 1-12 h) increased the nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the expression of lipid uptake and oxidation-related markers such as cluster of differentiation 36, fatty acid transport protein (FATP) 2, FATP5, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. Oxidative stress levels in TEB-treated cells (20-80 µM, 24 h) were higher, compared to those in the control. TEB (20-80 µM, 24 h) also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and lower levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in the cells. Thus, TEB can induce lipid accumulation by altering the expression of lipid-metabolizing molecules and can therefore impair lipid metabolism. Our data suggest that human exposure to TEB may be a risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
