Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) plays important roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis, and impairment of Akt activity has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL). We hypothesized that Akt activity might be impaired due to CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. In this study, we found that chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis was accompanied with reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in mice liver. Chronic ethanol exposure had no effects on the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), and led to a slight decrease of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) protein level. Ethanol exposure resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-Akt adducts, which was significantly inhibited by chlormethiazole (CMZ), an efficient CYP2E1 inhibitor. Interestingly, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated chronic ethanol-induced hepatic fat accumulation and the decline of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. In the in vitro studies, Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 (CYP2E1-HepG2) cells compared with the negative control HepG2 (NC-HepG2) cells, and 4-HNE treatment led to significant decrease of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in wild type HepG2 cells. Lastly, pharmacological activation of Akt by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) significantly alleviated chronic ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice. Collectively, these results indicate that CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for ethanol-induced suppression of Akt phosphorylation and pharmacological modulation of Akt in liver may be an effective strategy for the treatment of ethanol-induced fatty liver.
