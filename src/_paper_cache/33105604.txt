DPP-4 inhibitors might be protective against fatty liver. We previously reported that the systemic inhibition of insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) by the administration of OSI-906 (linsitinib), a dual IR/IGF1R inhibitor, induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipoatrophy in mice. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, on hepatic steatosis in OSI-906-treated mice. Unlike high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis is not characterized by elevations in inflammatory responses or oxidative stress levels. Linagliptin improved OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis via an insulin-signaling-independent pathway, without altering glucose levels, free fatty acid levels, gluconeogenic gene expressions in the liver, or visceral fat atrophy. Hepatic quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that perilipin-2 (PLIN2), major urinary protein 20 (MUP20), cytochrome P450 2b10 (CYP2B10), and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) are possibly involved in the process of the amelioration of hepatic steatosis by linagliptin. Thus, linagliptin improved hepatic steatosis induced by IR and IGF1R inhibition via a previously unknown mechanism that did not involve gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, or inflammation, suggesting the non-canonical actions of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of hepatic steatosis under insulin-resistant conditions.
