Tributyltin (TBT), a proven environmental obesogen, functions as a nanomolar agonist of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). However, the adverse effects of TBT on metabolism are incompletely understood. In this study, male ICR mice were administered TBT (5 and 50 μg·kg-1 ) by an intraperitoneal injection once every 3 days for 30 days from 28 days of age and bred for another 30 days after the last administration of TBT. We analyzed the effects of these exposures on the fat depot weights, serum lipid profile, serum leptin and adiponectin, hepatic lipid accumulation, and activity of AKT in the liver and skeletal muscle isolated from mice 8 mins after receiving an insulin injection. Pubertal exposure to TBTCl resulted in a higher body weight, increased epididymal and liver fat accumulation, hyperlipidemia, an elevated low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, serum adiponectin deficiency, worse glucose tolerance, and lower insulin-dependent AKT phosphorylation in the liver and muscle in mice. These results showed that TBT exposure induced peripheral insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in mice. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. DOI: 10.1002/tox.22562 PMID: 29675927 [Indexed for MEDLINE]
