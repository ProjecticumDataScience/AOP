Previously we demonstrated that aldose reductase (AR) inhibitor ameliorated alcoholic hepatic steatosis. To clarify the mechanism whereby AR inhibitor improves alcoholic hepatic steatosis, herein we investigated the effect of AR inhibitor on hepatic metabolism in mice fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with 5% ethanol. Nontargeted metabolomics showed carbohydrates and lipids were characteristic categories in ethanol diet-fed mice with or without AR inhibitor treatment, whereas AR inhibitor mainly affected carbohydrates and peptides. Ethanol-induced galactose metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis are important for the induction of hepatic steatosis, while AR inhibitor impaired galactose metabolism without perturbing fatty acid biosynthesis. In parallel with successful treatment of steatosis, AR inhibitor suppressed ethanol-activated galactose metabolism and saturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Sorbitol in galactose metabolism and stearic acid in saturated fatty acid biosynthesis were potential biomarkers responsible for ethanol or ethanol plus AR inhibitor treatment. In vitro analysis confirmed that exogenous addition of sorbitol augmented ethanol-induced steatosis and stearic acid. These findings not only reveal metabolic patterns associated with disease and treatment, but also shed light on functional biomarkers contribute to AR inhibition therapy. Copyright Â© 2018.
