Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has been shown to exert beneficial effects against insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg levonorgestrel; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free fatty acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, through XO, ADA and uric acid suppression. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
