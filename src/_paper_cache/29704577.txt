Remains unknown if dietary lipids and anabolic steroids (AS) can interact to modify energy metabolism, hepatic structure and function. We investigated the impact of AS on gene expression, lipid profile, redox status and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice treated with a diet rich in trans fatty acids. Seventy-two C57BL/6 mice were equally randomized into six groups and treated with a standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) alone or combined with testosterone cypionate (10 or 20 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. When combined with a HFD, AS reduced plasma HDL cholesterol levels. It also upregulated SREBP-1, PPARα, SCD-1 and ACOX1 gene expression; plasma and hepatic triglyceride levels; oxidative stress; circulating hepatic transaminase levels and NAFLD severity. Our finding indicated that the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione-s-transferase and superoxide dismutase was attenuated by HFD, an effect whose implications for AS-induced hepatotoxicity requires further investigation. Increased lipid, protein and DNA oxidative damage as well as worsening NAFLD in response to the interaction of HFD and AS were also potentially associated with the ability of AS to amplify the activation of regulatory lipid metabolism genes that are also involved in the control of cellular redox balance.
