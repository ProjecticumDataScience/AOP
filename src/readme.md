This script does entity extraction pipeline

# Entity Extraction Pipeline

-   **Load Models**
    -   `en_ner_bc5cdr_md`: pretrained NER model for **CHEMICAL**
        entities.
    -   `en_ner_bionlp13cg_md`: pretrained NER model for **SPECIES /
        ORGANISM** entities.
    -   Both are spaCy pipelines; only tokenization + `ner` are enabled
        for speed.
-   **Process Text**
    -   Each row's text is passed through both models â†’ produces two
        `Doc` objects with `doc.ents`.
-   **Filter Entities**
    -   From the first model keep `label_ == "CHEMICAL"`.
    -   From the second keep `label_ in ("SPECIES", "ORGANISM")`.
-   **Merge Overlaps**
    -   Overlapping spans of the same type are merged to avoid
        duplicates.
-   **Context Sentence**
    -   For each entity, find the sentence (`doc_spec.sents`) covering
        its start position.
-   **Clean & Filter**
    -   Remove very short entities (`len < MIN_LEN`).
-   **Return Results**
    -   Each entity is stored as a dict:
        `{entity, type, start, end, sentence}`.
    -   Results from both models are combined into one list.
